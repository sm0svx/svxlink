SvxLink build instructions
==========================

== Dependencies ==
Some dependencies need to be installed before building. First, the build tools:

* *gcc/g\+\+*: The GNU C/C++ compiler (Required)
* *make*: The Make build tool (Required)
* *cmake*: Version 2.8 or later. A makefile generator (Required)
* *groff*: Needed to build manual pages (Recommended)
* *gzip*: Needed to compress manual pages (Recommended)
* *doxygen*: Used to build developer documentation (Optional)
* *tar*: Needed to unpack downloaded source archives (Recommended)
* *git*: Needed to download bleeding edge/experimental source code (Optional)

SvxLink depend on some third party libraries. Since packages are named
differently in different distributions you need to do some research to find out
exactly what the packages are called in your distribution. Packages usually are
divided in two parts, a runtime part and a development part. Both are needed to
compile SvxLink. The development packages usually have a name ending in "-dev"
or "-devel".

* *libsigc++*: Version 2. A callback handling framework (Required)
* *libpopt*: Parse command line options (Required)
* *tcl*: The TCL scripting language (Required)
* *libgcrypt*: Cryptographic functions (Required)
* *libasound*: Alsa sound system support (Recommended)
* *libgsm*: GSM audio codec (Required)
* *libjsoncpp*: For json file support (Required)
* *libspeex*: The Speex audio codec (Optional)
* *librtlsdr*: Support for RTL2832U DVB-T/SDR USB dongles (Optional)
* *libgpiod*: Version 1. More modern approach for GPIO support (Optional)
* *libqt*: Version 4 or 5. Framework for graphical applications (Optional)
* *libssl*: OpenSSL Cryptography and SSL/TLS Toolkit

There also are some runtime dependencies which normally is needed to run a
SvxLink system.

* *alsa-utils*: Alsa tools for configuring sound levels etc (Recommended)
* *opus-tools*: Encode/decode Opus sound files (Optional)

== Required system user ==
Before trying to build and install using the commands below you also need to
create a user called 'svxlink'. There must also exist a group called 'daemon'
for the install to complete without errors.

How to create users and groups vary between different Linux distributions.
A common command that exist on many distributions is 'useradd'. The 'daemon'
group usually exist but if not, look for the 'groupadd' command.


== Build and install SvxLink with Usrp extension ==
SvxLink use the CMake build system. The basic pattern for building using CMake
looks like this:

  git clone https://github.com/dl1hrc/svxlink.git
  cd svxlink
  git checkout svxlink-usrp
  cd src
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  make doc
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig

This will build SvxLink and install it under /usr/local. The first argument to
cmake point out the source directory so the build directory can be created
anywhere. A common pattern is to place the build directly under the top source
code directory, hence the ".." in the example above.

To use another install location (e.g. /opt/svxlink) use the following line when
running cmake:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/svxlink ..

The "-D" switch is used to define CMake variables. There are both standardized
CMake variables and project specific ones.

To get install locations that would be used when building a binary package,
use the following cmake line:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DSYSCONF_INSTALL_DIR=/etc \
        -DLOCAL_STATE_DIR=/var ..

Cmake does normally only need to be run one time. After that the configuration
is cached so only "make" need to be run. Make will rerun cmake when necessary.

Some other good to know configuration variables that also can be set using -D
command line switch are:

  USE_ALSA          -- Set to NO to compile without Alsa sound support
  USE_OSS           -- Set to NO to compile without OSS sound support
  USE_QT            -- Set to NO to compile without Qt (no Qtel)
  BUILD_STATIC_LIBS -- Set to YES to build static libraries as well as dynamic
  LIB_SUFFIX        -- Set to 64 on 64 bit systems to install in the lib64 dir
