<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">svxlink.conf
&minus; Configuration file for the SvxLink server</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>svxlink</b>
is a general purpose voice service system for ham radio use.
This man-page describe the SvxLink server configuration file
format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">SvxLink look for
configuration files in a number of places. First it try to
find a user specific configuration file. SvxLink will look
for a user specific configuration file in:
<b>$HOME/.svxlink/svxlink.conf</b>. If no user specific
configuration file can be found, SvxLink will look for the
system wide configuration file
<b>/etc/svxlink/svxlink.conf</b>. The <b>--config</b>
command line option may also be used to specify an arbitrary
configuration file.</p>

<h2>FILE FORMAT
<a name="FILE FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
configuration file is in the famous INI-file format. A
generic example of how such a file might look like is shown
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">[SECTION1] <br>
VALUE1=1 <br>
VALUE2=&quot;TWO &quot; <br>
VAULE3=&quot;Multi &quot; <br>
&quot;line&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">[SECTION2] <br>
VALUE1=2</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This is a simple
format that contain name=value pairs that belong to a
section. In written text, a specific configuration variable
can be referred to as SECTION1/VALUE2 meaning
&quot;configuration variable VALUE2 in section
SECTION1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The same
variable name can exist in two different sections. For
example VALUE1 in section SECTION1 have the value 1 and
VALUE1 in section SECTION2 have the value 2. Values
containing spaces at the beginning or end of the line must
be surrounded by citation characters (see SECTION1/VALUE2).
Likewise with a multi line value (see SECTION1/VALUE3).</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
<a name="CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Here is the
description of all configuration variables that SvxLink
understands. The configuration variables are described
section for section.</p>

<h3>GLOBAL
<a name="GLOBAL"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The GLOBAL
section contains application global configuration data.
<b><br>
MODULE_PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify where the SvxLink
modules can be found. If MODULE_PATH is not specified, the
standard search paths for library files will be used. If
that also fails a hard-coded default will be used. What that
default is depend on the architecture but typically on a
x86_64 system it is /usr/lib64/svxlink. Leaving this
variable unset should work in most cases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LOGIC_CORE_PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify where the SvxLink logic
core plugins can be found. If not set, a hard-coded default
will be used. What that default is depend on the
architecture but typically on an x86_64 system it is
/usr/lib64/svxlink. Leaving this variable unset should work
in most cases. If this variable is set to empty, the
standard search paths for library files will be used (see
man 3 dlopen).</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="8%">


<p><b>LOGICS</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Specify a comma separated list of logic cores that
should be created. The logic core is the thing that ties the
transceiver and the voice services (modules) together. It
contains the rules for how the radio interface should be
handled. The specified name of a logic core must have a
corresponding section specified in the config file. This is
where the behavior of the logic core is specified.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CFG_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the path to a directory
that contain additional configuration files. If a relative
path is specified, the path will be relative to the
directory where the main configuration file is at. All files
in the specified directory will be read as additional
configuration. Filenames starting with a dot (hidden files)
or not ending in .conf are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TIMESTAMP_FORMAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This variable specifies the
format of the time-stamp that is written in front of each
row in the log file. The format string is in the same format
as specified in the <b>strftime</b>(3) manual page. The
default is &quot;%c&quot; which is described as: &quot;the
preferred date and time representation for the current
locale&quot;. The environment variables LC_TIME, LC_ALL and
LANG will affect how this time format will look. For
example, setting LC_TIME=&quot;sv_SE.UTF8&quot; will give
you Swedish time-stamp representation. Other examples of
format specifiers are:</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The last one
(%f) is a SvxLink specific formatting specifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
TIMESTAMP_FORMAT=&quot;%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S.%f&quot; would give
a time-stamp looking something like: &quot;29 Nov 2005
22:31:59.875&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CARD_SAMPLE_RATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable
determines the sampling rate used for audio input/output.
SvxLink always work with a sampling rate of 16kHz internally
but there still are some benefits from using a higher
sampling rate. On some sound cards the filters look pretty
bad at 16kHz and the amplitude response will not be uniform
which among other things can cause problems for the software
DTMF decoder.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Some sound
cards also sound very bad at 16kHz due to insufficient
anti-alias filtering or resampling effects. These, often
cheaper, sound cards sound OK at 48kHz.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The downside of
choosing a higher sampling rate is that it puts a little bit
more load on the CPU so if you have a very slow machine
(&lt;300MHz), it might not have the computational power to
handle it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Supported
sampling rates are: 16000 and 48000.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CARD_CHANNELS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
to specify how many channels to use when opening a sound
card. For normal sound cards the only practical values to
use are 1 for mono and 2 for stereo. The latter is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
sound card in stereo mode it is possible to use the left and
right channels independently to drive two transceivers. When
using the sound card in mono mode, both left and right
channels transmit/receive the same audio.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LOCATION_INFO</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Enter the section name that
contains information required for transferring positioning
data to location servers. Setting this item makes the system
visible on the EchoLink link status page and the APRS
network.</p>

<h3>Common Logic configuration variables
<a name="Common Logic configuration variables"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A logic core is
what define how SvxLink should behave on the RF channel. The
SvxLink server can handle more than one logic core and so
can be connected to more than one transceiver. When
configured, a logic core is loaded at runtime as a plugin.
See the LOGIC_CORE_PATH configuration variable for more
information on how SvxLink find the logic core plugins.</p>

of configuration sections for the modules to load. This
tells SvxLink which modules to actually load on startup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CALLSIGN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the callsign that
should be announced on the radio interface.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SHORT_VOICE_ID_ENABLE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A basic toggle to enable the
voice ID announcement during the short ID announcements. Set

</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PHONETIC_SPELLING</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify if the spelling of
callsign and other words should be announced on the radio
interface using phonetic or non-phonetic spelling.
&quot;1&quot; to use phonetic sounds (legacy default), or
&quot;0&quot; to use non-phonetic sounds. Note that this
option may not be available for all language packs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TIME_FORMAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify what format the time
should be announced as, valid options are
&quot;12&quot;/&quot;24&quot;. NOTE: may not work for all
language packs</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SHORT_IDENT_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of minutes between
short identifications. The purpose of the short
identification is to just announce that the station is on
the air. Typically just the callsign is transmitted. For a
repeater a good value is ten minutes and for a simplex node
one time every 60 minutes is probably enough. The
LONG_IDENT_INTERVAL must be an even multiple of the
SHORT_IDENT_INTERVAL so if LONG_IDENT_INTERVAL is 60 then
the legal values for SHORT_IDENT_INTERVAL are: 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. If unset or set to 0, disable
short identifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LONG_IDENT_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of minutes between
long identifications. The purpose of the long identification
is to transmit some more information about the station
status (new voice mails etc). The time of day is also
transmitted. A good value here is 60 minutes. If unset or
set to 0, disable long identifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IDENT_ONLY_AFTER_TX</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This feature controls when
identification is done. By default, identification is done
every time the SHORT_IDENT_INTERVAL expires. If this feature
is enabled, identification will be done only if there has
been a recent transmission. This feature is good for nodes
using an RF link to provide echolink to a repeater. Often,
in this situation, it is not desirable for the link to
identify unless legally necessary. Note that
SHORT_IDENT_INTERVAL still have to be set for this feature
to work. That config variable will then be interpreted as
the minimum number of seconds between identifications. The
LONG_IDENT_INTERVAL will not be affected by this
parameter.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>EXEC_CMD_ON_SQL_CLOSE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify a time, in
milliseconds, after squelch close after which entered DTMF
digits will be executed as a command without the need to
send the # character. To disable this feature, either
comment out the configuration row or set it to a value less
or equal to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>EVENT_HANDLER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Point out the TCL event handler
script to use. The TCL event handler script is responsible
for playing the correct audio clips when an event occur. The
default location is /usr/share/svxlink/events.tcl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DEFAULT_LANG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set the default language to use
for announcements. It should be set to an ISO code (e.g.
sv_SE for Swedish). If not set, it defaults to en_US which
is US English.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>RGR_SOUND_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of milliseconds to
wait after the squelch has been closed before a roger beep
is played. The beep can be disabled by specifying a value of
&minus;1 or commenting out this line. Often it is best to
use the SQL_HANGTIME receiver configuration variable to
specify a delay instead of specifying a delay here. This
configuration variable should then be set to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>REPORT_CTCSS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If set, will report the
specified CTCSS frequency upon manual identification (*
pressed). It is possible to specify fractions using
&quot;.&quot; as decimal comma. Disable this feature by
commenting out (#) this configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TX_CTCSS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable
controls if a CTCSS tone should be transmitted. Use a comma
separated list (no spaces!) to specify when to transmit a
CTCSS tone. These are the possible values: <b>SQL_OPEN</b>,
<b>LOGIC</b>, <b>MODULE</b>, <b>ANNOUNCEMENT</b> or
<b>ALWAYS</b>. Commenting out this configuration variable
will disable CTCSS transmit. The tone frequency and level is
configured in the transmitter configuration section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Point out a
section that contains the macros that should be used by this
logic core. See the section description for macros below for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>FX_GAIN_NORMAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The gain (dB) to use for audio
effects and announcements when there is no other traffic.
This gain is normally set to 0dB which means no gain or
attenuation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>FX_GAIN_LOW</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The gain (dB) to use for audio
effects and announcements when there is other traffic. This
gain is normally set to something like &minus;12dB so that
announcements and audio effects are attenuated when there is
other traffic present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>QSO_RECORDER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The QSO recorder is used to
write all received audio to files on disk. The format for
this configuration variable is &lt;command&gt;:&lt;config
section&gt;. The specified command is used to activate or
deactivate the QSO recorder. If the command for example is
set to 8, 81 will activate the recorder and 80 will
deactivate it. The command may also be left out. It will
then not be possible to control the QSO recorder using DTMF
commands. Even if the command is left out the colon must
always be specified. The config section point out a section
in the configuration file that holds configuration for the
QSO recorder. Have a look at the QSO Recorder Section

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SEL5_MACRO_RANGE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Define two comma separated
values here to map the Sel5 tone call to your macro area.
E.g. if you have defined: SEL5_MACRO_RANGE=03400,03499 then
all incoming Sel5 tone sequences from 03400 to 03499 are
mapped to the macros section (refer to Macros Section, next
chapter). Other sequences but the one defined under
OPEN_ON_SEL5 are ignored so it can be used to call other
stations via the repeater without a repeater reaction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>ONLINE_CMD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Define a DTMF command that is
used to switch the node between online and offline mode.
When in the off-state, the transmitter will not be turned on
by any event. If a module is active when the node is brought
offline, it will be deactivated and no module activation
will be allowed in offline mode. No other commands than the
online command will be accepted in the offline state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If the command
for example is set to 998877 then 9988771 will set the node
online and 9988770 will set it offline. If a module is
active or if the ACTIVATE_MODULE_ON_LONG_CMD is used, the
command must be prefixed with a star to work as expected.
The star means &quot;force core command&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Using this configuration
variable it is possible to specify a path to a UNIX 98 PTY
that SvxLink state events is published to. The published
events is in a simple text format using a space separated
list of values. SvxLink will create a softlink to the actual
slave PTY. For that reason, SvxLink must have write
permissions in the directory where the softlink should be
created. Monitoring the PTY output is as simple as doing a
<b>cat /path/to/pty</b> after starting SvxLink. See STATE
PTY FORMAT for more information on the format of the state
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Using this configuration
variable it is possible to specify a path to a UNIX 98 PTY
that allows a dtmf control of each single SvxLink logic.
SvxLink will create a softlink to the actual slave PTY. For
that reason, SvxLink must have write permissions in the
directory where the softlink should be created. Sending
commands to the PTY is as simple as doing a <b>echo
&rsquo;*1#&rsquo; &gt; /path/to/pty</b> after starting
SvxLink. The device works bidirectional, received dtmf
characters (from Rf) are output via this interface.</p>

DTMF_CTRL_PTY=/dev/shm/dtmf_ctrl</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_TO_TG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
to specify a comma separated list of pairs of tone
frequencies and talk groups. When one of the tone
frequencies is detected, the corresponding talk group will
be associated with the received audio. This can be used for
example by ReflectorLogic to automatically switch to a talk
group when one of the specified tone frequencies is
received. You also must configure CTCSS_FQ for all receivers
to open the squelch on the same tone frequencies. Otherwise
it will not work. Also, the CTCSS squelch detector must
actually be used in the receiver. It&rsquo;s not enough to
just set CTCSS_FQ.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
CTCSS_TO_TG=127.3:9993,136.5:9995</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_TO_TG_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The delay for reporting
detected talkgroup from when a CTCSS tone is detected. If
the squelch close before the delay time has expired, no
talkgroup will be reported. Default: 1000.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set to 1 to mute the receiver
when the transmitter is transmitting (default) or set it to
0 to make the RX active during transmissions. One might want
to set this to 0 if the link is operating on a split
frequency. Then the link can accept commands even when
it&rsquo;s transmitting. The normal setting is 1, to mute
the RX when transmitting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>MUTE_TX_ON_RX</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set to 1 to mute the
transmitter when the squelch is open (default) or set it to
0 to make the TX active during squelch open. One might want
to set this to 0 if the link is operating on a split
frequency or if it&rsquo;s connected to some full duplex

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>NO_REPEAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set this to 1 if you do NOT
want SvxLink to play back the incoming audio. This can be
used when the received audio is directly coupled by hardware
wiring to the transmitter. What you win by doing this is
that there is zero delay on the repeated audio. When the
audio is routed through SvxLink there is always an amount of
delay. What you loose by doing this is the audio processing
done by SvxLink (e.g. filtering, DTMF muting, squelch tail
elimination) and the ability to use remote receivers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IDLE_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of seconds the
repeater should have been idle before turning the
transmitter off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPEN_ON_1750</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
if it should be possible to open the repeater with a 1750Hz
tone burst. Specify the number of milliseconds the tone must
be asserted before the repeater is opened. Make sure that
the time specified is long enough for the squelch to have
time to open. Otherwise the repeater will open &quot;too
soon&quot; and you will hear an ugly 1750Hz beep as the
first thing. A value of 0 will disable 1750 Hz repeater
opening.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPEN_ON_CTCSS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
if it should be possible to open the repeater using a CTCSS
tone (PL). The repeater will activate after the specified
number of milliseconds on detection of any of the CTCSS
frequencies specified in the receiver configuration. Note
that the CTCSS squelch must actually be used as a squelch
detector in the receiver. It&rsquo;s not enough to just set
CTCSS_FQ.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPEN_ON_DTMF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
if it should be possible to open the repeater with a DTMF
digit. Only one digit can be specified. DTMF digits pressed
when the repeater is down will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPEN_ON_SEL5</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
if you want to open your repeater by using a selective tone
call that is often used in commercial radio networks.
Example: OPEN_ON_SEL5=03345 opens your repeater only if that
sequence has been received. You can use sequence lengths
from 4 to 25.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CLOSE_ON_SEL5</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
if you want to close your repeater by using a selective tone
call that is often used in commercial radio networks.
Example: CLOSE_ON_SEL5=03345 closes your repeater if that
sequence has been received. You can use sequence lengths
from 4 to 25.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPEN_ON_SQL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
if it should be possible to open the repeater just by
keeping the squelch open for a while. The value to set is
the minimum number of milliseconds the squelch must be open
for the repeater to open.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPEN_ON_SQL_AFTER_RPT_CLOSE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Activate the repeater on just a
squelch opening if there have been no more than the
specified number of seconds since the repeater closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPEN_SQL_FLANK</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Determines if OPEN_ON_SQL and
OPEN_ON_CTCSS should activate the repeater when the squelch
open or close. If set to OPEN, the repeater will activate
and start retransmitting audio immediately. No
identification will be sent. If set to CLOSE, the repeater
will not activate until the squelch close. An identification
will be sent in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IDLE_SOUND_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When the repeater is idle, a
sound is played. Specify the interval in milliseconds
between playing the idle sound. An interval of 0 disables
the idle sound.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_FLAP_SUP_MIN_TIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Flapping squelch suppression is
used to close the repeater down if there is interference on
the frequency that open the squelch by short bursts. This
configuration variable is used to specify the minimum time,
in milliseconds, that a transmission must last to be
classified as a real transmission. A good value is in
between 500-2000ms.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_FLAP_SUP_MAX_COUNT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Flapping squelch suppression is
used to close the repeater down if there is interference on
the frequency that open the squelch by short bursts. This
configuration variable is used to specify the maximum number
of consecutive short squelch openings allowed before
shutting the repeater down. A good value is in between
5-10.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>ACTIVATE_MODULE_ON_LONG_CMD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable
activate a feature that might help users not aware of the
SvxLink command structure. The idea is to activate the
specified module when a long enough command has been
received. The typical example is an EchoLink user that is
used to just typing in the node ID and then the connection
should be established right away. Using this configuration
variable, specify a minimum length and a module name. If no
module is active and at least the specified number of digits
has been entered, the given module is activated and the
command is sent to it. To be really useful this feature
should be used in cooperation with
EXEC_CMD_ON_SQL_CLOSE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
this configuration variable is set to &quot;4:EchoLink&quot;
and the user types in 9999, the EchoLink module is first
activated and then the command 9999 is sent to it, which
will connect to the ECHOTEST server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IDENT_NAG_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Tell repeater users that are
not identifying to identify themselves. The number of
seconds to wait for an identification, after the repeater
has been activated, is set using this configuration
variable. A valid identification is considered to be a
transmission longer than the time set by the
IDENT_NAG_MIN_TIME configuration variable. We don&rsquo;t
know if it&rsquo;s really an identification but it&rsquo;s
the best we can do. Setting it to 0 or commenting it out
disables the feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IDENT_NAG_MIN_TIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This is the minimum time, in
milliseconds, that a transmission must last to be considered
as an identification. This is used as described in the
IDENT_NAG_TIMEOUT configuration variable.</p>

<h3>ReflectorLogic
<a name="ReflectorLogic"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
ReflectorLogic is used to connect to an SvxReflector server.
The SvxReflector will distribute all audio to all connected
nodes. To actually send audio to the reflector from a logic
core, set up a link between the two logics using
LogicLinking. More than one logic core can be connected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">SvxReflector
also offer traffic separation using talk groups so that
multiple QSOs can be ongoing through the same reflector
server without interfering with each other. The set of talk
groups that a node monitors for activity is configurable so
that a talk group can be automatically selected when
it&rsquo;s active. After a configurable timeout the node
will return to monitor all configured talk groups if there
is no activity on the currently selected talk group. Which
talk group to select for outgoing traffic for a node can be
set to a default, selected by the CTCSS tone used and/or
selected using DTMF commands. The DTMF commands are entered
through the logic linking definition associated with the
reflector. So if a command prefix of 9 have been specified
for a link, selecting talk group 888 will be achieved by
entering the command 91888#.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The reflector
connection will be authenticated using X.509 certificates.
Both the server and the client require authentication. The
AUTH_KEY authentication method that was previously used is
deprecated. The certificate generation process is mostly
automated. The contents of the certificate can be customized
using the configuration variables with the name prefix
CERT_. Default values are good in most cases. CERT_EMAIL may
be good to specify so that the SvxLink node owner can be
contacted. Ask the reflector sysop what the convention
is.</p>

to be configured with SRV records for all reflector servers
serving that domain. For example, if the domain is
example.org, there must be one or more SRV entries in the
DNS with the name _svxreflector._tcp.example.org. Each SRV
record contain information about hostname, port, priority
and weight. The priority determine in which order SvxLink
will try to connect to the servers. The weight is used to
give different servers with the same priority a probability
for how often it will be selected.</p>

HOST_WEIGHT.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>HOST_PRIO</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The priority value to use for
entries in the HOSTS list. The priority determine in which
order SvxLink will try to connect to the specified servers.
See also HOST_PRIO_INC. Default: 100.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>HOST_PRIO_INC</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The value with which to
increase the priority value for each entry in the HOSTS
list. The first value will be the one specified by
HOST_PRIO. Default: 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>HOST_WEIGHT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The weight value will determine
how often a server will be selected in comparison to servers
with the same priority. This variable is only useful when
one want to set the weight in relation to other SRV records
looked up in the DNS. The weight values for entries in the
HOSTS list will always be the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>HOST_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The default TCP/UDP port number
used by the reflector server. The client do not need to open
any ports in the firewall. Default: 5300.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CALLSIGN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The callsign of this node. The
callsign also serves as the username when authenticating to
the SvxReflector server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>AUTH_KEY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The authentication key, or
password, used when authenticating to the SvxReflector
server. When connecting to a modern reflector server,
certificates are used instead of an AUTH_KEY. Then this
configuration variable should be left unset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>JITTER_BUFFER_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A jitter buffer is used to
prevent gaps in the audio when the network connection do not
provide a steady flow of data. Set this configuration
variable to the number of milliseconds to buffer before
starting to process the audio. Default: 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DEFAULT_TG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The node will select this talk
group on local incoming traffic if no other talk group is
currently selected. Default: 0 (no talk group).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>MONITOR_TGS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A comma separated list of talk
groups which the node will monitor for activity when no
other talk group is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to mark talk groups as more prioritized than others
by adding one or more plus signs after the talk group
number. More plus signs mean higher priority. While a talk
group is selected, and there are activity on a talk group
with higher priority, the higher prio talk group will be
selected unless there have been local activity on the
node.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">MONITOR_TGS=112++,240,2403+,2403123</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">will monitor
the TGs for Sweden, Sweden district 3 and a specific TG
#2403123. Traffic on talk group 2403 will be prioritized and
112 will have the highest priority.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TG_SELECT_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of seconds after
which a selected talk group will be unselected. The node
will return to talk group 0 (no talk group) and start
monitoring the configured talk groups again. The value must
be larger than zero. Default: 30 seconds.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TG_SELECT_INHIBIT_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Talkgroup selection is
inhibited when there is activity on the local frequency that
does not activate a talkgroup. Only activation due to remote
activity (monitoring) is inhibited. A talkgroup can be
activated as usual by using any method for local activation.
This feature make it possible to conduct a local QSO without
being disturbed by remote reflector traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Use this
configuration variable to set the number of seconds of
inactivity before the node will go back to monitoring remote
talkgroup activity. The default value is taken from
TG_SELECT_TIMEOUT if this variable is not set. Setting a
value of 0 will disable the feature entirely.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>ANNOUNCE_REMOTE_MIN_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The minimum number of seconds
between announcements of the same TG for remote TG
activations. If the same TG is remotely activated repeatedly
it will not be announced until at least the number of
seconds specified in this configuration variable have
passed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>NODE_INFO_FILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The configuration file to use
for sending information regarding this client to the
reflector server. This is not a required configuration. It
is mostly free-form JSON but the general structure should be
kept so that SvxLink and the reflector server can fill in
dynamic information about the node like signal strengths for
receivers. Use the default node_info.json as a template. You
can add more information rather freely but don&rsquo;t
change the overall structure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>MUTE_FIRST_TX_LOC</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Mute the first transmission
after selecting a talk group due to local activity. This
feature is good to have enabled for a number of reasons. One
reason is to suppress short openings of a talk group when
someone just make a single transmission to test the local
node. Another reason is for to allow someone to submit DTMF
commands to the node without disturbing the reflector
network. An example is that someone activates a talk group
using CTCSS but then immediately select another talk group
using DTMF. In that case no transmission will be made on the
first talk group. This feature is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>MUTE_FIRST_TX_REM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Mute the first transmission
after selecting a talk group due to remote activity. This
feature can be enabled to let local node users enter DTMF
commands without disturbing an active talk group. As an
example, the local node monitors a talk group that is
active. However, no one on the local node participates in
the QSO and a local user want to select another talk group.
With this feature enabled it is possible to do that without
transmitting into the reflector network while entering DTMF
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">This feature is
not enabled by default since it is a bit unintuitive. If a
local user hear a call and want to answer that call, he must
first make a short transmission to &quot;open up&quot; the
local node. This is easy to forget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TMP_MONITOR_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable
determines after how many seconds a manually added temporary
talk group monitor will time out. Set to 0 to disable this
feature. Default is 3600, one hour.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>UDP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of seconds between
UDP heartbeat messages sent to the reflector server. This
configuration variable can normally be left at the default
value but if you get frequent disconnects due to UDP
heartbeat timeout it may help to lower this value. Default:
15</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>QSY_PENDING_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set to the number of seconds to
enable following a QSY request on squelch activity. That is,
after a remote QSY request, during the configured number of
seconds, it will be possible to follow a QSY request by just
pushing the PTT instead of having to use DTMF commands. Note
that the timer starts when the QSY request is received so
the time it takes to play the QSY announcement is also
included in the timeout time. A good value is within 10 to
15 seconds. Default is -1 (disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>VERBOSE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set to 0 to suppress reflector
leave/join printouts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to set audio codec parameters using the same
configuration variables as documented for networked
receivers and transmitters. For example, to lighten the
encoder CPU load for the Opus encoder, set
OPUS_ENC_COMPLEXITY to something lower than 9. <b><br>
CERT_PKI_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The path to the directory where

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CERT_KEYFILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The path to the private key for
the X.509 client certificate. This file will be auto
generated if it does not exist. It must be kept secure since
this is what authenticates your node. It must NOT be sent in
the clear over the internet for example. Also, if you loose
this file you will have to ask the reflector sysop to issue
a new certificate for the new key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
CERT_KEYFILE=/var/lib/svxlink/pki/MYCALL.key</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CERT_CSRFILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The path to the certificate
signing request for the X.509 client certificate. This file
will be auto generated if it does not exist or if the
configuration information has been changed. When a new CSR
is generated, the reflector sysop need to sign it before it
will become active.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
CERT_CSRFILE=/var/lib/svxlink/pki/MYCALL.csr</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CERT_CRTFILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The path to the X.509 client
certificate. This file is a public file that is used to
identify your node. It is sent to the reflector during the
authentication procedure. It will be created after the CSR
has been signed by the reflector sysop. The reflector will
send this file to the client during the authentication
procedure if it&rsquo;s missing on the node or if the
certificate has been updated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CERT_DOWNLOAD_CA_BUNDLE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The CA bundle is by default
downloaded from the reflector server if it&rsquo;s missing
or need to be updated. Set this configuration variable to 0
to disable that behaviour. That should be done if you want
to provide your own CA bundle.</p>

<h3>QSO Recorder Section
<a name="QSO Recorder Section"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The QSO recorder
is used to record all received audio to files on disk. All
audio from receivers, modules and logic links are recorded.
Announcements are not recorded. <b><br>
REC_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
to specify in which directory to write the audio files. A
good place is /var/spool/svxlink/qso_recorder.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>MIN_TIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If the duration of the recorded
content for a file is less then MIN_TIME milliseconds, the
file will be deleted when the file is closed. Default: 0
(empty files will be deleted).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>MAX_TIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Setting this configuration
variable will set an upper limit for the file size of a
recording. No more than MAX_TIME seconds of content will be
recorded to a single file. When the maximum time have been
reached, the file is closed and another file is created.
Note that it is not the maximum time that the recording has
been active that we are setting a limit for but rather how
much content that have been recorded to the file. If nothing
is recorded, the file can stay open indefinitely. Default: 0
(no limit)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SOFT_TIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">To not get abrupt breaks in
recordings it is possible to set a soft break time.
Let&rsquo;s say that MAX_TIME is set to 3600 seconds (one
hour). If we set SOFT_TIME to 300 seconds (five minutes) the
QSO recorder try to close the file on a squelch close
somewhere between 55 and 60 minutes. In this way we may
avoid getting transmissions split up between files. Default:
0 (no limit)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>MAX_DIRSIZE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the maximum total size
in megabytes of the files in the recording directory. If the
limit is exceeded, the oldest files are deleted. The
directory size is checked upon file close so the size may
grow temporarily past the limit with at most the size of one
recorded file. Only files which have a filename starting
with &quot;qsorec_&quot; will be considered for deletion. If
using an ENCODING_CMD, make sure that the
&quot;qsorec_&quot; prefix is not removed from the target
filename unless you really want the MAX_DIRSIZE feature to
skip them. Default: 0 (no limit)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DEFAULT_ACTIVE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If this configuration variable
is set to 1, the QSO recorder will be activated by default
when SvxLink start. Default: 0 (default inactive)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If a timeout is specified, the
activation state of the QSO recorder will return to the
value specified in the DEFAULT_ACTIVE configuration variable
when the node has been idle for the specified number of
seconds. When DEFAULT_ACTIVE is unset or 0, if the QSO
recorder is manually activated it will be automatically
deactivated after the specified amount of time of
inactivity. When DEFAULT_ACTIVE is set to 1, if the QSO
recorder is manually deactivated it will be automatically
activated after the specified amount of time of inactivity.
Default: 0 (no timeout)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>QSO_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set this configuration variable
if you want to close the currently opened file and open a
new one after each QSO. The number of seconds the node
should be idle before closing the file should be specified.
Default: 0 (no QSO timeout)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>ENCODER_CMD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify a command to be
executed after a new wav file have been written to disk.
This makes it possible to use an external encoder utility to
encode the wav file to another format. Even though this
configuration variable was added to run an external encoder
it could do more complicated things with the file if needed.
A couple of examples would be to transfer the file to
another computer or to send a notification e-mail. If the
command line get too complicated it may be a good idea to
write a script instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The encoder
command will be run under a shell so normal shell operators
like redirects and pipes may be used. The shell specified in
the SHELL environment variable will be used and if not set,
/bin/sh will be used. The &quot;&minus;c&quot; command line
option will be added so the complete command will look
something like: $SHELL &minus;c &quot;$ENCODER_CMD&quot;. A
number of %-codes can be included in the command. They have
the following meaning:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The encoder
will be started in the background and it will not be stopped
even if SvxLink exits. It will run in the background until
it&rsquo;s done. As long as SvxLink is running it is
monitoring the encoding processes. If a process run for
longer than one hour it will be killed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
SvxLink will never remove the original recording so that
have to be done in the encoder command. Here are a couple of
examples:</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">ENCODER_CMD=/usr/bin/oggenc

\&quot;%f\&quot;</p>

<h3>Macros Section
<a name="Macros Section"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A macros section
is used to declare macros that can be used by a logic core.
The logic core points out the macros section to use by using
the MACROS configuration variable. The name of the MACROS
section can be chosen arbitrarily as long as it match the
MACROS configuration variable in the logic core
configuration section. There could for example exist both a
[RepeaterLogicMacros] and a [SimplexLogicMacros]
section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A macro is a
kind of shortcut that can be used to decrease the amount of
key presses that have to be done to connect to common
EchoLink stations for example. On the radio side, macros are
activated by pressing &quot;D&quot; &quot;macro number&quot;
&quot;#&quot;. A macros section can look something like the
example below. Note that the module name is case
sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">[Macros] <br>
1=EchoLink:9999# <br>
2=EchoLink:1234567# <br>
9=Parrot:0123456789#</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
pressing DTMF sequence &quot;D1#&quot; will activate the
EchoLink module and connect to the EchoTest conference
node.</p>

<h3>Logic Linking
<a name="Logic Linking"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A logic linking
configuration section is used to specify information for a
link between two or more SvxLink logic cores. Such a link
can for example be used to connect a local repeater to a
remote repeater using a separate link transceiver. The link
is activated/deactivated using DTMF commands and/or
automatically depending on your configuration. When the link
is active, all audio received by one logic will be
transmitted by the other logic(s).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The name of the
logic linking section can be chosen freely. In the example
configuration file, there is a section [LinkToR4]. To use a
logic linking section in a logic core it must be pointed out
by the LINKS configuration variable in the GLOBAL section.
Example: GLOBAL/LINKS=LinkToR4 <b><br>
CONNECT_LOGICS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A comma separated list of logic
specifications for the logic cores to connect together. Each
logic specification has three parts separated by colons:
&lt;logic name&gt;:&lt;command&gt;:&lt;announcement
name&gt;. The &quot;logic name&quot; is the name of the
logic to include in the link. To manually activate or
deactivate the link from the just specified logic,
&quot;command&quot; is used. The &quot;announcement
name&quot; is used when announcing link related activities
like activation or deactivation. Both &quot;command&quot;
and &quot;announcement name&quot; may be left empty if no
manual control is wanted. An example config line may look
like this:</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">RepeaterLogic_2m:99:SK3GW,RepeaterLogic_70cm:94:SK3GK</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">It will include
two logics in the link, RepeaterLogic_2m and
RepeaterLogic_70cm. From the 2m side, the link will be
activated when the user send command 991 and deactivated
when the user send command 990. Upon activation, an
announcement like &quot;activating link to SK3GW&quot; will
be played back. From the 70cm side the command will be 941
and 940 respectively. The announcement when activating the
link from the 70cm side will be something like
&quot;activating link to SK3GK&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DEFAULT_ACTIVE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The link will be connected
automatically during startup of SvxLink if this
configuration variable is set to 1. Also, if a link is
manually disconnected by a user it will be automatically
reconnected after some time of inactivity. The time is
specified by setting the TIMEOUT configuration variable. If
the TIMEOUT variable is not set, no automatic reactivation
will be done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of seconds after
which the link will be automatically deactivated if there
have been no activity. If 1 have been specified for
DEFAULT_ACTIVE, this configuration variable will specify
after how many seconds the link will be reactivated after
being manually deactivated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>ACTIVATE_ON_ACTIVITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Enter a comma separated list of
logics, which should automatically activate the link if
there is activity (e.g. squelch open, announcements etc) in
it. One possible application for this is for example to make
the connection of a microphone/speaker combination (without
DTMF encoder) for brief announcements but without having to
constantly listen in. Example:
ACTIVATE_ON_ACTIVITY=MicSpkrLogic</p>

<h3>Local Receiver Section
<a name="Local Receiver Section"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A local receiver
section is used to specify the configuration for a receiver
connected to the sound card. In the default configuration
file there is a Local configuration section called
<b>Rx1</b>. The section name could be anything. It should
match the RX configuration variable in the logic core where
the receiver is to be used. The available configuration
variables are described below.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="9%"></td>

<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>A single character uniquely identifying this receiver.
The RX identity can for example be used in the TCL event
scripts to get different roger sounds for different
receivers when using a receiver voter.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>AUDIO_DEV</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the audio device to
use. Normally alsa:plughw:0. Have a look at the AUDIO DEVICE
SPECIFICATIONS chapter for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>AUDIO_CHANNEL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the audio channel to
use. SvxLink can use the left/right stereo channels as two
mono channels. Legal values are 0 or 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>AUDIO_DEV_KEEP_OPEN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The normal behaviour for
SvxLink is to open an audio device when needed and close it
when it does not have to be open anymore. This may cause
problems in some applications or with some sound hardware.
Set this variable to 1 to force SvxLink to keep the audio
device open from application start to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LIMITER_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set the threshold, in dBFS, for
the audio limiter. The audio limiter really is a compressor
with a very steep compression ratio like 10:1. The limiter
is used to help keeping down the audio level for
overmodulating stations. For a properly calibrated SvxLink
node max FM deviation is -6dBFS. A good value to start with
for this parameter is then -6 but try to lower it further
(like -9 to -12) if it does not affect audio quality
negatively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_DET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the type of squelch
detector to use. Possible values are: VOX, CTCSS, SERIAL,
EVDEV, SIGLEV, PTY, GPIO, GPIOD, HIDRAW or COMBINE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The VOX squelch
detector determines if there is a signal present by
calculating a mean value of the sound samples. The VOX
squelch detector behavior is adjusted with VOX_FILTER_DEPTH
and VOX_THRESH. VOX is actually a bit of a misnomer since
it&rsquo;s a &quot;Voice Operated Squelch&quot; and VOX
actually means &quot;Voice Operated Transmitter&quot;.
However, the term VOX is widely understood by hams all over
the world so we&rsquo;ll stick with it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The CTCSS
squelch detector checks for the presence of a tone with the
specified frequency. The tone frequency is specified using
the CTCSS_FQ config variable. The thresholds are specified
using the CTCSS_OPEN_THRESH and CTCSS_CLOSE_THRESH config
variables. Other config variables that effect the CTCSS
squelch is: CTCSS_MODE, CTCSS_SNR_OFFSETS, CTCSS_BPF_LOW,
CTCSS_BPF_HIGH, CTCSS_EMIT_TONE_DETECTED.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The SERIAL
squelch detector use a pin in a serial port to detect if the
squelch is open. This squelch detector can be used if the
receiver have an external hardware indicator of when the
squelch is open. Specify which serial port/pin to use with
SERIAL_PORT and SERIAL_PIN.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The EVDEV
squelch detector read squelch events from a
/dev/input/eventX device. An example where this could be
useful is if you have a USB audio device with some buttons
on it. Some of these devices generate key press events, much
like a keyboard. Specify which /dev/input device node to use
using the EVDEV_DEVNAME config variable. Set which events
that should open and close the squelch using the EVDEV_OPEN
and EVDEV_CLOSE config variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The GPIO
squelch detector read a pin on the GPIO Port. Depending on
the level of the pin, the squelch is switched. A HIGH (3.3V)
at the pin set the squelch to open and a LOW (GND) level
will set the squelch to closed. Specify which squelch pin to
use with the GPIO_SQL_PIN configuration variable. On some
devices, like the Orange Pi, you also need to set the
GPIO_PATH configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The GPIOD
squelch detector read a pin in the GPIO subsystem using the
gpiod library. Depending on the level of the pin, the
squelch is switched. Set GPIOD interaction up using the
following configuration variables: SQL_GPIOD_CHIP,
SQL_GPIOD_LINE, SQL_GPIOD_BIAS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The SIGLEV
squelch detector use signal level measurements to determine
if the squelch is open or not. Which signal level detector
to use is determined by the setting of the SIGLEV_DET
configuration variable. The open and close thresholds are
set using the SQL_SIGLEV_OPEN_THRESH and
SQL_SIGLEV_CLOSE_THRESH configuration variables. If using
the NOISE signal level detector note the following. The
detector is not perfect (it&rsquo;s affected by speech) so
you will also want to setup SQL_HANGTIME to prevent it from
closing in the middle of a transmission. A value between
100-300ms is probably what you need. If using this squelch
type in cooperation with a voter, you&rsquo;ll also probably
need to setup SQL_DELAY to get correct signal level
measurements. A value of about 40ms seem to be OK. Also,
when using the NOISE signal level detector the input audio
must be unsquelched since silence will be interpreted as a
high signal strength.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The PTY squelch
expects a very simple protocol over a pseudo-tty device,
created by SvxLink at runtime. An &rsquo;O&rsquo; over this
pty device indicate an open squelch, a &rsquo;Z&rsquo; is a
closed squelch. Define the slave pty using PTY_PATH (e.g.
PTY_PATH=/tmp/sql) and SvxLink will create a link to the
specified path from it&rsquo;s pseudotty slave device
(/dev/pts/X). This can be used by a script to interface
custom devices, modems or other hardware to SvxLink. Look
for nhrcx.pl or trx_pty_ctrl.py for an example. It is
possible to specify the same PTY for multiple functions
(e.g. DTMF, ptt etc) in both TX and RX configurations. This
may be good if there is one script handling all
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The HIDRAW
squelch supports human interface devices (HID), USB devices
like CM108 soundcard e.g. used in the URI Echolink adapter
made by DMK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The COMBINE
squelch make it possible to combine multiple squelch types
using a logical expression. The expression is set up using
the SQL_COMBINE configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_START_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The squelch start delay is of
most use when using VOX squelch. For example, if the
transceiver makes a noise when the transmitter is turned
off, that might trigger the VOX and cause an infinite loop
of squelch open/close transmitter on/off. Specify the number
of milliseconds that the squelch should be &quot;deaf&quot;
after the transmitter has been turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify a delay in milliseconds
that a squelch open indication will be delayed. This odd
feature can be of use when using a fast squelch detector in
combination with the signal level detector. A squelch delay
will allow the signal level detector to do its work before
an indication of squelch open is sent to the logic core. A
delay might be needed when using the voter to choose among
multiple receivers. A normal value could be somewhere in
between 20-100ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_HANGTIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">How long, in milliseconds, the
squelch will stay open after the detector has indicated that
it is closed. This configuration variable will affect all
squelch detector types. Settable at runtime.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_EXTENDED_HANGTIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">At low signal strengths it can
be beneficial to use a longer squelch hangtime so that it is
less likely for the squelch to close. This configuration
variable is unset by default. A value of 1000 milliseconds
may be a good value to start out with. To enable the
extended squelch hangtime feature, set up the
SQL_EXTENDED_HANGTIME_THRESH variable. Settable at
runtime.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_EXTENDED_HANGTIME_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">At low signal strengths it can
be beneficial to use a longer squelch hangtime so that it is
less likely for the squelch to close. This configuration
variable is unset by default. When set to a signal level it
will activate the extended squelch hangtime feature. When
the signal strength during a transmission fall below the set
threshold, the extended hangtime will be used. Start out
with a value between 10 to 15. The SQL_EXTENDED_HANGTIME
variable is used to set how long the extended squelch
hangtime should be. Make sure that you have calibrated the
signal level detector before turning this feature on.
Otherwise it will not work as expected. Settable at
runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
to set an upper limit, in seconds, for how long the squelch
is allowed to be open. If the timeout value is exceeded the
squelch is forced to closed. If the squelch close for real,
everything is back to normal. When it opens the next time a
squelch open will be signaled. For example, use this feature
to make sure that a faulty receiver cannot block the system
indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>VOX_FILTER_DEPTH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of milliseconds to
create the mean value over. A small value will make the vox
react quicker (&lt;200) and larger values will make it a
little bit more sluggish. A small value is often better.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>VOX_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The threshold that the mean
value of the samples must exceed for the squelch to be
considered open. It&rsquo;s hard to say what is a good
value. Something around 1000 is probably a good value. Set
it as low as possible without getting the vox to false
trigger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_MODE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable set
the CTCSS detection method used. These are the ones to
choose from:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p><b>0 (Default)</b> Will choose the detection mode that
is the default in the software. At the moment this is mode
4, &quot;Overlap+Estimated SNR+Frequency
estimation&quot;.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p><b>1 (Neighbor bins)</b> This detection mode will use
three narrow frequency bands (&#732;8Hz) to do the
detection. One band is centered around the tone to be
detected and then there are one band above and one below the
tone. These bands are used to estimate the noise floor. This
is the detector that have been used in SvxLink for a long
time. It is however rather slow with its detection time of
about 450ms. There is no good reason to use this detector
anymore but it is kept in case the new detector does not
work for some hardware setup.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p><b>2 (Estimated SNR)</b> This is a newer detector
implementation which have some improvements. The most
notable difference is that it is faster. The mean detection
time will be around 200ms. This is the default detection
mode if not specified. This detector will use a larger
passband to estimate the noise floor which make it more
stable. The default config use the whole CTCSS passband but
this can be customized using the CTCSS_BPF_LOW and
CTCSS_BPF_HIGH config variables.</p></td></tr>

<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p><b>3 (Estimated SNR+Phase)</b> This detector is a bit
experimental. It is even faster and more narrow than the
other detection modes. The mean detection time will be
something like 150ms. The detection bandwidth is very narrow
and very sharp so that no adjacent tones will trigger the
detector. The price to pay for these improvements is that is
it a bit less sensitive.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p><b>4 (Overlap+Estimated SNR+Frequency estimation)</b>
This is an improvement of the mode 3 detector which use
another method for extracting the phase information from the
signal. This phase information can be used to calculate an
estimation of the tone frequency. The accuracy is like
tenths of a Herz. Like the mode 3 detector, this detector is
faster and more selective. With its 0.75% frequency
tolerance, it will not trigger on adjacent CTCSS tones.
However, the &quot;undetect&quot; algorithm does not use the
frequency estimation so the squelch may be held open by an
adjacent tone if already in active state. One downside is
that it is a bit more CPU hungry due to using 75% overlap in
the frequency analysis, thus processing each sample three
times. The reason to use overlap is that the detector will
be faster.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_FQ</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If CTCSS (PL,subtone) squelch
is used (SQL_DET is set to CTCSS), this config variable sets
the frequency of the tone to use. The tone frequency ranges
from 67.0 to 254.1 Hz. There actually is nothing that will
stop you from setting the frequency to something outside
this range but there is no guarantee that it will work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If desired it
is possible to specify a comma separated list of tone
frequencies in which case the squelch will open on all the
tone frequencies. Note that for this feature to work well
the receivers frequency response in the CTCSS frequency
range (67.0 to 254.1Hz) need to be reasonable flat. When
choosing tones, try to select tones that are close to each
other. However, selecting tones too close may cause both to
trigger. Also do not select tones that are a multiple of
another tone since overtones may trigger the wrong one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_OPEN_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If CTCSS (PL, subtone) squelch
is used (SQL_DET is set to CTCSS), this config variable sets
the required tone level to indicate squelch open. The value
is some kind of estimated signal to noise dB value. If using
CTCSS mode 2, 3 or 4 it is helpful to set up the
CTCSS_SNR_OFFSETS config variable. This will make the SNR
estimation pretty good. Default threshold is 15dB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_CLOSE_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If CTCSS (PL, subtone) squelch
is used (SQL_DET is set to CTCSS), this config variable sets
the required tone level to indicate squelch close. The value
is some kind of estimated signal to noise dB value. If using
CTCSS mode 2, 3 or 4 it is helpful to set up the
CTCSS_SNR_OFFSETS config variable. This will make the SNR
estimation pretty good. Default threshold is 9dB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_SNR_OFFSET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable
should not be used unless you know why you use it. Using
CTCSS_SNR_OFFSETS is often more appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_SNR_OFFSETS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This config variable is used
when CTCSS_MODE is set to 0, 2, 3 or 4. It will adjust the
estimated SNR values so that they become very close to a
real SNR value. This value will have to be adjusted if
CTCSS_FQ, CTCSS_MODE, CTCSS_BPF_LOW or CTCSS_BPF_HIGH
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Use the
siglevdetcal utility to find out what to set this config
variable to. There is no requirement to set this config
variable up. The downside is that you will then need to
experiment more with the CTCSS_OPEN_THRESH and
CTCSS_CLOSE_THRESH config variables to find the correct
squelch level. If using multiple CTCSS frequencies it may
not be possible to find good threshold values due to uneven
frequency characteristics for the receiver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The format for
this config variable is a comma separated list of
frequency:offset pairs. The CTCSS_SNR_OFFSET variable may be
used as a form of fallback value that is used if a specific
tone frequency in use is missing from this list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_BPF_LOW</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When CTCSS_MODE is set to 0, 2,
3 or 4, this config variable will set the low cutoff
frequency for the passband filter. It normally should not
have to be adjusted but could improve the detector if some
interference falls within the passband (e.g. mains hum).
Note however that the more narrow you make the passband, the
less stable the detector will be. You may need to compensate
by increasing the open/close thresholds or by setting up
SQL_DELAY and SQL_HANGTIME. Default is 60Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_BPF_HIGH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When CTCSS_MODE is set to 0, 2,
3 or 4, this config variable will set the high cutoff
frequency for the passband filter. It normally should not
have to be adjusted but could improve the detector if some
interference falls within the passband. Note however that
the more narrow you make the passband, the less stable the
detector will be. You may need to compensate by increasing
the open/close thresholds or by setting up SQL_DELAY and
SQL_HANGTIME. Default is 270Hz.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_EMIT_TONE_DETECTED</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable
defaults to 1 which mean that a tone detected signal is
emitted when a CTCSS tone is detected. This is required for
the function of other features in SvxLink like CTCSS_TO_TG
and OPEN_ON_CTCSS. In some situations it may be necessary to
disable this behavior, like when using advanced squelch
configurations where some tones are actively blocked due to
nearby interference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_DEBUG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set this to 1 to enable
continuously printing SNR values for the CTCSS tone
measurements. This is only meant to be activated temporarily
while searching for a problem or for initial adjustment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SERIAL_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If SQL_DET is set to SERIAL,
this config variable determines which serial port should be
used for hardware squelch input (COS - Carrier Operated
Squelch). Note: If the same serial port is used for the PTT,
make sure you specify exactly the same device name.
Otherwise the RX and TX will not be able to share the port.
Example: SQL_PORT=/dev/ttyS0</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SERIAL_PIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If SQL_DET is set to SERIAL,
this config variable determines which pin in the serial port
that should be used for hardware squelch input (COS -
Carrier Operated Squelch). It is possible to use the DCD,
CTS, DSR or RI pin. If inverted operation is desired, prefix
the pin name with an exclamation mark (!).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
SQL_PIN=!CTS</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SERIAL_SET_PINS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set the specified serial port
pins to a static state. This can be good if using a pin for
reference voltage or if a pin have to be in a certain state
to not interfere with the operation of some equipment. There
are two pins that are possible to use, RTS and DTR. If
prefixed with an exclamation mark (!), the pin will be
cleared and if not it will be set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
SERIAL_SET_PINS=RTS!DTR will set RTS and clear DTR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>EVDEV_DEVNAME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify which /dev/input device
node to use for the EVDEV squelch detector. To find out
which device node and event codes to use, install the evtest
utility. Find a candidate device node under /dev/input/ or
/dev/input/by-id/ and try the evtest utility on it. Press
some keys on the device you want to read events from. If
you&rsquo;re in luck, events will be printed on the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>EVDEV_OPEN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use the evtest utility, as
described above, to find out type, code and value for the
event you want to use to open the squelch. For example if
type is 1, code is 163 and value is 1, set this config
variable to 1,163,1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>EVDEV_CLOSE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use the evtest utility, as
described above, to find out type, code and value for the
event you want to use to close the squelch. For example if
type is 1, code is 163 and value is 0, set this config
variable to 1,163,0. If you set the same type,code,value
combination for both EVDEV_OPEN and EVDEV_CLOSE, that event
will toggle the squelch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>GPIO_PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
to set the path to the sys control devices for GPIO. This
normally is /sys/class/gpio but on some hardware, like the
Orange Pi, the path is /sys/class/gpio_sw.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>GPIO_SQL_PIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If SQL_DET is set to GPIO this
configuration variable is used to choose which GPIO pin to
use for squelch input. The most common name is
gpio&lt;number&gt;, like gpio4. Some GPIO drivers use more
complex names, like gpio33_pe11. If inverted operation is
desired, prefix the pin name with an exclamation mark
(!).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
GPIO_SQL_PIN=!gpio4</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_GPIOD_CHIP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The GPIO chip to use for
squelch. The application tries to figure out whether the
value is the path to the GPIO chip, its name, label or
number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
SQL_GPIOD_CHIP=gpiochip0</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_GPIOD_LINE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If GPIOD was specified in
SQL_DET, set this config variable to the gpiod line of the
GPIO pin to use. If a number is specified it is assumed to
be the GPIO pin offset within the chip. If a pin name is
specified SvxLink will try to find a pin with that name
within the chip.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, the
pin will be active high but if the pin specification is
prefixed with an exclamation mark it will be active low
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">For some
hardware platforms you may need to also set the
SQL_GPIOD_CHIP configuration variable, if the pin you want
to use is not on the default GPIO chip.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
SQL_GPIOD_LINE=17</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_GPIOD_BIAS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This config variable is only
available when SvxLink has been built with libgpiod &gt;=
1.5. It makes it possible to set if the squelch GPIO pin
should be pulled up or down. If you don&rsquo;t know what
that mean you should check the documentation for your
hardware interface, whether it require a pull up or down.
It&rsquo;s an electronics thing. In essence, a pull up will
force the pin high if nothing is connected to it and a pull
down will force it low.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_COMBINE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable is
used to set a logical expression that is used to combine
multiple squelch types. The expression syntax consist of
names for configuration file sections where a specific
squelch type is set up and of the operators &rsquo;|
(logical or), &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; (logical and) and
&rsquo;!&rsquo; (logical negation). Parts of the expression
may be grouped by surrounding them with parentheses,
effectively changing operator precedence. The normal
precedence is that &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; bind harder to its
operands than &rsquo;|&rsquo;. The &rsquo;!&rsquo; operator
bind hardest.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Below is a
simple example of how to set up a combined squelch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">[Rx1:CTCSS]
<br>
SQL_DET=CTCSS <br>
CTCSS_FQ=77.0 <br>
CTCSS_SNR_OFFSETS=77.0:-3.22</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">[Rx1:SIGLEV]
<br>

... <br>
SQL_DET=COMBINE <br>
SQL_COMBINE=Rx1:CTCSS | Rx1:SIGLEV <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The
configuration section names used above is just a convention
but it is wise to include the name of the associated RX for
better diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Squelch timing
parameters like SQL_DELAY, SQL_HANGTIME etc may be set up in
the receiver configuration section (Rx1 above). The
parameters will not be applied to each subsquelch but rather
to the combiner itself. It is often better to set up
parameters in each squelch specific configuration section
unless you really know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_SIGLEV_RX_NAME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When using the SIGLEV squelch
type, specify the name of the receiver that provide the
signal level. This is only useful when the squelch
configuration is not in the same configuration section as
the receiver, like when using the COMBINE squelch type. The
default is to use the same configuration section as where
the SIGLEV squelch is configured.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SIGLEV_DET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Choose which type of signal
level detector to use. The available choices are:
&quot;NONE&quot;, &quot;NOISE&quot; (default),
&quot;TONE&quot;, &quot;AFSK&quot;, &quot;SIM&quot; or
&quot;CONST&quot;. Depending on other configuration there
may be more choices available. For example, if a Ddr
receiver is used there will also be a DDR signal level
detector available. The signal level detector is only needed
when using multiple receivers in a voter configuration or
when using the SIGLEV squelch type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Type NONE
disable the signal level detector. This may be used if no
signal level detector is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Type NOISE use
a bandpass filter in the range of 5 - 5.5kHz
(CARD_SAMPLE_RATE &gt;= 16000) or a high-pass filter at
3.5kHz (CARD_SAMPLE_RATE = 8000) to estimate the amount of
noise present on the signal. If the passband contain a small
amount of energy, a strong signal is assumed. If the
passband contain more energy, a weaker signal is assumed.
The noise detector must be calibrated for the receiver and
audio levels you use. This is done using the SIGLEV_SLOPE
and SIGLEV_OFFSET configuration variables. See chapter
CALIBRATING THE SIGNAL LEVEL DETECTOR below for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Type TONE is
not really a signal level detector but rather a transport
mechanism for getting signal level measurements from a
remote receiver site, linked in via RF, to the main SvxLink
site. It is using ten tones, one for each signal level step,
in the high audio frequency spectrum (5.5 - 6.4kHz, 100Hz
step) to indicate one of ten signal levels. Only the
receiving part have been implemented in SvxLink at the
moment. On the remote receiver side an Atmel AVR ATmega8 is
used to map the signal level voltage to tone frequencies.
Use the TONE_SIGLEV_MAP configuration variable to map each
tone to a corresponding signal level value in between 0 -
100.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Type AFSK is
like the TONE detector really a transport mechanism. Signal
level values are transmitted using Audio Frequency Shift
Keying, AFSK, over the receiver uplink channel from a remote
receiver site. AFSK reception must have been enebled by
setting OB_AFSK_ENABLE=1 and also optionally
IB_AFSK_ENABLE=1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Type SIM is a
simulated signal level detector that can be used to debug
problems in the SvxLink software. Use the SIGLEV_MIN,
SIGLEV_MAX, SIGLEV_DEFAULT, SIGLEV_TOGGLE_INTERVAL and
SIGLEV_RAND_INTERVAL configuration variables to configure
the simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Type CONST is
not a detector at all. Instead it is possible to set a
constant signal level. This can be used for audio sources
that does not have the concept of a signal level. If
configured in a receiver managed by a Voter it can be used
to determine priority in comparison to other receivers and
audio sources. Use the SIGLEV_CONST configuration variable
to set the signal level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>HID_DEVICE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This parameter defines the
device your hidraw adapter is connected to. This port is
created by the linux/hidraw driver. e.g.
HID_DEVICE=/dev/hidraw3</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>HID_SQL_PIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Define the pin your hardware
squelch (from RX) is connected to. Valid values are VOL_UP,
VOL_DN, MUTE_PLAY or MUTE_REC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
HID_SQL_PIN=VOL_UP</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SIGLEV_SLOPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The slope (or gain) of the
signal level detector. See chapter CALIBRATING THE SIGNAL
LEVEL DETECTOR below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SIGLEV_OFFSET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The offset of the signal level
detector. See chapter CALIBRATING THE SIGNAL LEVEL DETECTOR
below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SIGLEV_BOGUS_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable set
an upper threshold for the estimated signal level when using
the noise signal level detector. If the estimation goes over
the given threshold, a signal level of 0 will be reported.
This can be used as a workaround when using a receiver with
squelched audio output. When the squelch is closed, the
receiver audio is silent. The signal level estimator will
interpret this as a very strong signal. Setting up the bogus
signal level threshold will counteract this behavior but a
better solution is to use unsquelched audio if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">By default this
feature is disabled. If enabling it, start with a value
somewhere around 120.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TONE_SIGLEV_MAP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable is
used to map tones to signal level values when
SIGLEV_DET=TONE. It is a comma separated list of ten values
in the 0 - 100 range. The first value map to the 5500Hz
tone, the second to the 5600Hz tone and so on. The last
value map to the 6400Hz tone. What levels the tones should
be mapped to depends on the tone sender implementation. The
default tone map is 10,20,30...,100.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The Atmel AVR
processor used by the author have a reverse mapping so that
the first tone (5500Hz) indicate the highest signal strength
and the last tone (6400Hz) indicate the lowest signal
strength. It is also not linear since it&rsquo;s more
important to have fine measurement granularity in the lower
signal strength range. This is how the mapping look for the
AVR: 100,84,60,50,37,32,28,23,19,8.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_SIGLEV_OPEN_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This is the squelch open
threshold for the SIGLEV squelch detector. If using the
NOISE signal level detector, make sure to first calibrate
the signal level detector using the SIGLEV_SLOPE and
SIGLEV_OFFSET configuration variables. The signal level
detector should normally be calibrated so that full signal
strength is 100 and no signal is 0. Depending on your
background noise level a good value for this configuration
variable is between 5 and 20.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_SIGLEV_CLOSE_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This is the squelch close
threshold for the SIGLEV squelch detector. If using the
NOISE signal level detector, make sure to first calibrate
the signal level detector using the SIGLEV_SLOPE and
SIGLEV_OFFSET configuration variables. The signal level
detector should normally be calibrated so that full signal
strength is 100 and no signal is 0. Depending on your
background noise level a good value for this configuration
variable is between 1 and 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SIGLEV_MIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The minimum signal level used
by SIM signal level detector.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SIGLEV_MAX</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The maximum signal level used
by SIM signal level detector.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SIGLEV_DEFAULT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The default signal level set on
startup by the SIM signal level detector.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SIGLEV_TOGGLE_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The interval, in milliseconds,
that the SIM signal level detector will use to toggle
between the maximum and the minimum signal levels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SIGLEV_RAND_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The interval, in milliseconds,
that the SIM signal level detector will use between
randomizing a new signal level value. At each interval, the
simulator will randomly either increase or decrease the
signal level with one step.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DEEMPHASIS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Apply a deemphasis filter on
received audio. The deemphasis filter is used when taking
audio directly from the detector in the receiver, like when
using a 9k6 packet radio connector. If not using a
deemphasis filter the high frequencies will be amplified
resulting in a very bright (tinny) sound.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_TAIL_ELIM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Squelch tail elimination is
used to remove noise from the end of a received
transmission. This is of most use when using CTCSS or SIGLEV
squelch with unsquelched input audio. A normal value is a
couple of hundred milliseconds. Note that the audio will be
delayed by the same amount of milliseconds. This does not
matter much for a simplex link but for a repeater the delay
might be annoying since you risk hearing the end of your own
transmission.</p>

<p>The incoming signal will be amplified by the specified

input audio level can&rsquo;t be set high enough on the
analogue side. A value of 6dB will double the signal level.
Note that this is a digital amplification. Hence it will
reduce the dynamic range of the signal so usage should be
avoided if possible. It&rsquo;s always better to correct the
audio level before sampling it.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PEAK_METER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This is a help to adjust the
incoming audio level. If enabled it will output a message
when distortion occurs. To adjust the audio level, first
open the squelch. Then increase the audio level until
warning messages are printed. Decrease the audio level until
no warning messages are printed. After the adjustment has
been done, the peak meter can be disabled. 0=disabled,
1=enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_DEC_TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the DTMF decoder type.
Set it to <b>INTERNAL</b> to use the internal software DTMF
decoder. To use the S54S interface featuring a hardware DTMF
decoder, set it to <b>S54S</b>. To control it over a pseudo
tty device set it to <b>PTY</b>. Setting it to PTY will
install the PTY dtmf decoder. SvxLink creates a symlink
linked to a slave pty device on runtime. The name has to be
defined with DTMF_PTY. If AFSK reception is enabled using
OB_AFSK_ENABLE/IB_AFSK_ENABLE, remotely decoded DTMF digits
may be received by setting this configuration variable to
<b>AFSK</b>. <b>NONE</b> or commenting it out will disable
DTMF detection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_MUTING</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Mute the audio during the time
when a DTMF digit is being received. Note that the audio
will be delayed like 40-75ms, depending on the DTMF decoder
used, to give the decoder time to do its work. This does not
matter much on a simplex link but on a repeater it could be
annoying since you will hear the last 40-75 milliseconds of
your own transmission. To counteract the added delay one can
set up the SQL_TAIL_ELIM configuration variable to at least
40 milliseconds. Legal values for DTMF_MUTING are
0=disabled, 1=enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_HANGTIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable can
be used if the DTMF decoder is too quick to indicate digit
idle. That does not matter at high signal strengths but for
weaker signals and mobile flutter it&rsquo;s not good at
all. Each DTMF digit will be detected multiple times. Using
this configuration variable, the time (ms) a tone must be
missing to be indicated as off can be extended. Setting this
value too high will cause the decoder to be a bit sluggish
and it might consider two digits as one. The hang time only
affect consecutive digits of the same value (e.g. 1 1). If a
detected digit differs from the previously detected digit
(e.g 1 2), the hang time is immediately canceled and the
detected digit is considered as a new one. A good default
value is 50-100ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_SERIAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When using an external hardware
DTMF decoder this config variable is used to specify a
serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyS0).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_PTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When using the PTY DTMF
&quot;decoder&quot; this configuration variable will set the
path to the PTY slave softlink that the external interface
script use to communicate to SvxLink. Over this softlink a
very simple communication protocol is used to notify SvxLink
about received DTMF digits: 0-9, A-F, *, #. &quot;E&quot; is
the same as &quot;*&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is the same as
&quot;#&quot;. Sending a digit tell SvxLink when it starts.
To tell SvxLink that the digit has ended, send a space
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The PTY DTMF
&quot;decoder&quot; can be used by an external script to
interface custom devices, modems or other hardware to
SvxLink. Look for nhrcx.pl or trx_pty_ctrl.py for an
example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to specify the same PTY for multiple functions (e.g.
squelch, ptt etc) in both TX and RX configurations. This may
be good if there is one script handling all functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
/tmp/rx1_dtmf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_MAX_FWD_TWIST</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">DTMF use two tones to encode
digits 0-9, A-F. These two tones should normally have the
sample amplitude. The difference in amplitude is called
twist. Forward twist is when the higher frequency tone is
lower in amplitude than the lower frequency tone. According
to the standards, 8dB forward twist should be allowed. Some
transmitters do not correctly modulate the DTMF tones to get
zero twist. The most common situation is that the forward
twist is too large. Increasing this configuration variable
above 8dB might allow DTMF from these transmitters to be
detected. When doing this, the DTMF detector will be more
sensitive to noise and might cause more false triggers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_MAX_REV_TWIST</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">DTMF use two tones to encode
digits 0-9, A-F. These two tones should normally have the
sample amplitude. The difference in amplitude is called
twist. Reverse twist is when the lower frequency tone is
lower in amplitude than the higher frequency tone. According
to the standards, 4dB reverse twist should be allowed but
SvxLink will allow 6dB by default. The most common reason
for getting reverse twist is a bad de-emphasis filter or
that none at all is used, like when taking audio directly
from the FM discriminator. Have a look at the DEEMPHASIS
configuration variable before starting to modify this
configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_DEBUG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set to 1 to continuously print
software DTMF decoder decision parameters. This should only
be used for a short while to pinpoint problems with the DTMF
decoding since it will print one row of analysis parameters
100 times per second. The following parameters are
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>1750_MUTING</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Mute the audio during a call
tone of 1750Hz is received. Note that the audio will be
delayed 75ms to give the tone detector time to do its work.
This does not matter much on a simplex link but on a
repeater it could be annoying since you will hear the last
75 milliseconds of your own transmission. To counteract the
added delay one can set up the SQL_TAIL_ELIM configuration
variable to at least 75 milliseconds. Legal values for
1750_MUTING are 0=disabled, 1=enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SEL5_TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Define here your selective tone
call system. You have the choice of the following types:
ZVEI1, ZVEI2, ZVEI3, PZVEI, PDZVEI, DZVEI, CCITT, EEA,
CCIR1, CCIR2, NATEL, EURO, VDEW, AUTO-A, MODAT, PCCIR and
EIA. Only one system can be used at the same time. Please
take into consideration that some Sel5 standards are using
the same or similar tones so it may have some unwanted
effects if you define ZVEI1 for SvxLink and a (e.g.) ZVEI3
sequence is received.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SEL5_DEC_TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">At the moment only
SEL5_DEC_TYPE=INTERNAL is valid. Maybe we have support for
some external tone detectors later. To disable SEL5 tone
decoding, specify NONE or just comment the configuration
variable out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>RAW_AUDIO_UDP_DEST</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Setting this configuration
variable makes it possible to stream the raw audio from the
sound device to an UDP socket. The sample format is the one
used internally in SvxLink, that is each sample is
represented by a 32 bit float. The sample rate is the same
as the one chosen for the audio device. The destination is
specified as ip-address:port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
RAW_AUDIO_UDP_DEST=127.0.0.1:10000</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OB_AFSK_ENABLE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set to 1 to enable reception of
metadata like signal level measurements, DTMF digits and
tone detections via out-of-band (OB) AFSK. The out-of-band
AFSK is transmitted above the voice band so that it is
possible to transmit AFSK bursts at the same time as someone
is speaking. The AFSK bursts are filtered out before the
audio is handed on to the next stage so normal users should
never hear the AFSK bursts. The AFSK feature is typically
used on a remote receiver uplink. The protocol used is
SvxLink specific. Data is transmitted in 300Bd with a shift
of 170Hz and a center frequency of 5500Hz. The RemoteTrx
application have the capability to transmit this
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OB_AFSK_VOICE_GAIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">To be able to send both voice
and AFSK at the same time it may be necessary to lower the
level of the voice audio as to not overdrive the
transmitter. This is compensated in the link receiver by
amplifying the voice audio back to its original level. This
configuration variable should thus be set to the negated
value of the same configuration variable in the transmitter
section of the transmitting RemoteTrx. If it&rsquo;s set to
-6dB in the transmitter configuration it should be set to
6dB here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IB_AFSK_ENABLE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set to 1 to enable reception of
an initial signal level measurement via in-band (IB) AFSK.
This is used in cooperation with the out-of-band AFSK
feature to quickly transfer a signal level measurement to
get the squelch opened. The in-band AFSK is transmitted in
the voice band and can thus use the higher baudrate of
1200Bd. Since it&rsquo;s only transmitted when the squelch
is closed the end user will not hear the AFSK burst. The
AFSK feature is typically used on a remote receiver uplink.
The protocol used is SvxLink specific. Data is transmitted
in 1200Bd with a shift of 1000Hz and a center frequency of
1700Hz. The RemoteTrx application have the capability to
transmit this protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTRL_PTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set this configuration variable
to the path of a PTY to use for controlling a receivers
frequency and modulation. This can be used to interface a
receiver to SvxLink using a translation script, like
trx_pty_ctrl.py. To set the receive frequency, SvxLink will
send the sequence &quot;f&lt;frequency&gt;;&quot;. The
frequency will be in Hz, e.g. f145550000; will be sent to
set the receiver to 145.550MHz.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">To set the
modulation the command is &quot;m&lt;modulation&gt;;&quot;.
Look at the documentation of the MODULATION configuration
variable to see which modulations that are available. To set
&quot;normal&quot; 25kHz channel spaced FM the command would
be mFM;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to specify the same PTY for multiple functions (e.g.
squelch, ptt etc) in both TX and RX configurations. This may
be good if there is one script handling all functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LADSPA_PLUGINS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Used to set up one or more
LADSPA plugins to process the received audio. The processing
chain is applied just before the final stages of the
receiver audio processing and will only affect how the audio
sounds. Any digital signal processing done on the audio
before that, like DTMF, CTCSS etc, is unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;LADSPA PLUGIN USAGE&quot; for more information.</p>

<h3>Ddr Receiver Section
<a name="Ddr Receiver Section"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A special kind
of local receiver is the Digital Drop Receiver (DDR). It
will use either the rtl_tcp utility or a direct USB
connection to interface to a RTL2832U based DVB-T USB dongle
and use that as a wide-band receiver. These USB dongles can
be bought cheaply from an Internet shop (&#732;$10). The
radio performance may not be great but better than one might
think. Usage as a cheap local coverage receiver or as a link
receiver may work very well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">One big
advantage of using a wide-band receiver is that it is
possible to monitor more than one narrow band channel at a
time. The only limit is the CPU power and the bandwidth of
the wide-band tuner. You probably need a Pentium4 or better
to fulfill the CPU demands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Getting the
DVB-T dongle running is out of scope for this document but
what you absolutely need to do is to find out the frequency
error on your specific dongle. When you have figured out
what the frequency error is, set up the FQ_CORR
configuration variable in the wide-band receiver
configuration section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The rtl_tcp
utility is in a package named similar to something like
rtl-sdr. When you have the rtl-sdr stuff installed, just
start rtl_tcp. No command line arguments are needed. Then
configure a Ddr receiver in SvxLink. All configuration
variables that are available for an ordinary local receiver
is also available for a Ddr receiver, except the audio
device related ones which are just ignored. The following
configuration variables are available in addition to the
ordinary ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">For a Ddr there also is a
special signal level detector available, DDR, that will
measure the RF power before demodulation. This is much more
reliable than estimating the signal power through the audio
which is normally done in SvxLink. The drawback is that the
Ddr signal level is not completely comparable to the
ordinary SvxLink signal level measurements since it have a
larger dynamic range. Set SIGLEV_DET=DDR to activate the Ddr
signal level detector.</p>

<h3>Wide-band Receiver Section

described above, to handle multiple narrow-band channels
using the same hardware. The only hardware supported at the
moment is RTL2832U based DVB-T USB dongles. SvxLink access
the dongle directly via USB or through the rtl_tcp utility,
which make the dongle available on a TCP network port. The

if there are multiple dongles connected to the computer.
When looking for dongles, SvxLink will try to match the
string given in this configuration variable in different
ways. First, if it&rsquo;s a digit, a match against the
device index is tried. The device index is just a number,
zero and up, that is given to a dongle when it&rsquo;s
inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If the device
index does not match, a match against the beginning, end or

960000).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>FQ_CORR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This is probably the most
important configuration variable. Most dongles are far off
in frequency so they need to be calibrated. Calibrating the
dongle can be done in multiple ways. The recommended way is
to use the devcal utility that is distributed along with
SvxLink. The calibration procedure is described in the
devcal (1) manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The end result
should be a correction value for how far off the dongle is
in frequency counted in parts per million (PPM). That is,
how many Hz per MHz is the tuner off by. Typical values are
in the range -100 to 100.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CENTER_FQ</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The frequency, in Hz, that the
wide-band tuner should be placed at. This configuration
variable should normally be left unset since SvxLink will
try to place the wide-band tuner to cover all set up Ddr
frequencies. SvxLink will also try to avoid placing a Ddr on
the center frequency of the wide-band spectrum since there
is usually some noise there. Only use this configuration
variable if you need to override the automatic placement for
some reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>XVRTR_OFFSET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If a transverter is used, this
configuration variable can be set to the frequency offset
that the transverter introduce. The frequency set here will
be added to the center frequency of the wide-band
receiver.</p>

<p>If unset, automatic gain is used. Do not use automatic
gain control if using the DDR signal level detector. That
may mess up the measurements. Finding a good gain setting
may be hard. Too little and you will not hear the signals
you want to hear. Too much and the tuner will be driven into
distortion. One way to decide the maximum usable gain is to
use the PEAK_METER explained below. When there are no
distortion warning messages printed or just a single one now
and then you have found the max gain. You should probably
back at least one step down from this value. If the signals
you want to receive are very strong, set the gain as low as
possible.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">What gain
values that are available is tuner dependent. SvxLink will
print the available gain values when it establishes the
connection to the tuner. Typical values are in the range -10
to 50dB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PEAK_METER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If PEAK_METER is set to 1, a
warning will be printed every time the tuner is driven into
distortion. If it happens too often the gain should be
lowered. At most, one warning per second will be
printed.</p>

<h3>LocalSim Receiver Section

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Receiver type
&quot;Voter&quot; is a &quot;receiver&quot; that combines
multiple receivers and selects one of them to take audio
from when the squelch opens. Which receiver to use is
selected directly after squelch open. It is possible to set
up a voting delay which will make the voter wait a while
before choosing which RX to use. This will give all
receivers some time to report their signal strengths. After
the initial choice have been made a periodic check is done
to see if any of the other receivers receive a stronger
signal. In the default configuration file there is a voter
section called <b>Voter</b>.</p>

</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>RECEIVERS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify a comma separated list
of receivers that the voter should use. Optionally the
receiver name may be followed by a colon and a squelch delay
value. This can be used to adjust the voting delay for
receivers that always are slower to open for some reason.
The delay value given will be subtracted from the voting
delay if the receiver is the first one to open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The usage of
the delay value is best illustrated with an example.
Let&rsquo;s say we have three receivers where two of the
receivers take at most 100ms to report signal level and one
receiver requires 300ms. We then need to set the
VOTING_DELAY to something like 350ms so as to be sure that
all receivers get a chance to report their signal level
measurement. If only the slow receiver opens there will be a
total delay of 300+350=650ms. This is unnecessarily long
since the other two receivers should have reported their
signal strength way earlier. It&rsquo;s thus safe to shorten
the voting delay for the slow receiver, so we do this:
RECEIVERS=FastRx1,FastRx2,SlowRx:200. The total squelch open
delay will now be 100+350=450ms for the fast receivers and
300+350-200=450ms for the slow receiver. That is, all
receivers are now equally fast.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
RECEIVERS=Rx1,Rx2:200,Rx3</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>VOTING_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the delay in
milliseconds that the voter will wait after the first
squelch open detection until the decision of which receiver
to use is made. This time must be set sufficiently high to
allow all receivers to calculate and report the signal
level. Incoming audio and DTMF digits will be buffered for
all receivers during the delay time so nothing will be lost,
but of course the audio will be delayed the specified amount
of time. This is most noticeable when using a repeater
logic. Use the BUFFER_LENGTH configuration variable to
adjust the buffer length. The default voting delay is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>BUFFER_LENGTH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
to adjust the length of the voting delay buffer. If not
specified, the buffer length will be the same as the voting
delay. When using the voter with a repeater logic, try to
keep this variable at 0 to reduce the latency. Only increase
it if you feel audio is lost in the beginning of
transmissions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>REVOTE_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This is the interval time in
milliseconds with which the voter will check if another
receiver is receiving a stronger signal. If that is the
case, a receiver switch will be initiated. Default is 1000
milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>HYSTERESIS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The hysteresis setting will
prevent the voter from switching back and forth between two
receivers that are equal in signal strength. For a switch to
occur, the other receivers signal strength must exceed the
current receivers signal strength by the percent specified
in this configuration variable. So if the hysteresis is set
to 50% and the received signal strength on the current
receiver is 40, a signal strength of 40*1.5=60 is required
on another receiver to initiate a switch. At squelch open,
if the received signal strength plus hysteresis is larger
than 100, the voting delay will be skipped. The default
hysteresis is 50 percent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>RX_SWITCH_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When a receiver switch is
initiated by the voter, it will wait the number of
milliseconds specified in this configuration variable before
actually performing the switch. The switch will only occur
if the other receivers signal strength is still higher.
Default is 500 milliseconds.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SQL_CLOSE_REVOTE_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The voter will wait the number
of milliseconds specified in this config variable after a
squelch close before voting in another receiver. There are
two reasons for using this delay. The first is to prevent
the voter from going into idle state immediately when the
squelch close for a fluttery signal. If it goes to idle, the
procedure with voting delay may cause longer dropouts than
necessary. The second reason to use this config variable is
if different receivers have different hang times (explicitly
or implicitly). If both a slow and fast receiver is
receiving the same signal and the faster is currently
chosen, when the PTT is released the slower receiver will be
voted before closing. This will cause a double squelch tail
and double roger beep. Default is 500 milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>COMMAND_PTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the path to a PTY that
can be used to control the voter from the operating system.
Available commands:</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The difference
between MUTE and DISABLE is that in the mute state only the
content (audio, dtmf, selcall tone detectors etc) is muted
but the receiver is still operational. That is probably only
useful if also setting VERBOSE=1 so that squelch open/close
can be monitored in the log. That may be useful if a new
receiver is connected to the system which you want to
monitor for a while without having it actually participate
in the voting. It may also be of use if a receiver
misbehaves in which case it can be monitored until it stops
misbehaving.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Commands can be
issued using a simple echo command from the shell. Example:
echo &quot;DISABLE Rx1&quot; &gt;/dev/shm/voter_ctrl</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>VERBOSE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set this to 1 to enable verbose
mode. In verbose mode the squelch state events of the
satellite receivers will be printed. This can be used for
fine tuning voter timing parameters. Default: 0
(disabled)</p>

<h3>Networked Receiver Section
<a name="Networked Receiver Section"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A networked
receiver section is used to specify the configuration for a
receiver connected through a TCP/IP network. In the default
configuration file there is a networked receiver
configuration section called <b>NetRx</b>. The section name
could be anything. It should match the RX configuration
variable in the logic core where the receiver is to be used.
The available configuration variables are described below.
How to use a networked receiver is further described in the
<b>remotetrx</b>(1) manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TCP_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The TCP port that RemoteTrx
listen on. The default is 5210.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LOG_DISCONNECTS_ONCE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set this configuration variable
to 1 to suppress logging of multiple disconnect messages in
a row, like when there is no RemoteTrx running on the other
side. Thus, failed reconnect attempts will not be logged at
all. This may be of use if a RemoteTrx is missing for a long
time or if it&rsquo;s only used from time to time. The
default is 0 which means that all reconnect attempts will be
logged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>AUTH_KEY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This is the authentication key
(password) to use to connect to the RemoteTrx server. The
same key have to be specified in the RemoteTrx
configuration. If no key is specified in the RemoteTrx
config, the login will be unauthenticated. A good
authentication key should be 20 characters long. If the same
RemoteTrx is used for both RX and TX, the same key must be
specified in the RX as well as in the TX configuration
section. The key will never be transmitted over the network.
A HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response procedure will be used for
authentication.</p>

<td width="82%">


<p>The audio codec to use when transferring audio from this
remote receiver. Available codecs are: RAW (512kbps), S16
(256kbps), GSM (13.2kbps), SPEEX (8-25kbps), OPUS
(8-64kbps). These are raw bit-rate values. There will be
some overhead added to this so the real bit-rates on the
wire are a little bit higher. The OPUS codec is the most
modern one and it also have the best quality for a given
bit-rate.</p> </td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_FRAMES_PER_PACKET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. Each
Speex frame contains 20ms audio. If using a low bit-rate
configuration, the network overhead will be quite noticeable
if sending each frame in its own packet. One way to lower
the overhead is to send multiple frames in each network
packet. The drawback with doing this is that you get more
delay. If setting this option to something like 4 (default),
the delay will be about 4x20=80ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_QUALITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. Specify
the encoder quality using a number between 0-10. Lower
values give poorer quality and lower bit-rates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_BITRATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. Specify
the bit-rate to use. Speex will snap to the nearest lower
possible bit-rate. Possible values range from 2150 to 24600
bps. You should probably not specify quality at the same
time as bit-rate. Not sure though...</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_COMPLEXITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. The
complexity setting (0-10) tells the encoder how much CPU
time it should spend on doing a good job. The difference in
SNR between the lowest and highest value is about 2dB. Set
it as high as possible without overloading the CPU on the
encoding computer (check CPU usage using command
&quot;top&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_VBR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) variable bit-rate encoding. If enabled,
the encoder will try to keep a constant quality by
increasing the bit-rate when needed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_VBR_QUALITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. The
quality (0-10) to use in variable bit-rate mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_ABR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. The
average bit-rate encoding will try to keep a target bit-rate
by continuously adjusting the quality. This configuration
variable specify the target bit-rate and enable ABR. It also
need to have VBR enabled so don&rsquo;t force it to off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_DEC_ENHANCER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex decoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) the perceptual enhancer in the decoder.
Perceptual enhancement is a part of the decoder which, when
turned on, attempts to reduce the perception of the
noise/distortion produced by the encoding/decoding process.
In most cases, perceptual enhancement brings the sound
further from the original objectively (e.g. considering only
SNR), but in the end it still sounds better (subjective
improvement).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_FRAME_SIZE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Opus encoder setting. Specify
how large, in milliseconds, each audio packet should be.
Default: 20ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_COMPLEXITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Opus encoder setting. The
complexity setting (0-10) tells the encoder how much CPU
time it should spend on doing a good job. Set it as high as
possible without overloading the CPU on the encoding
computer (check CPU usage using command &quot;top&quot;).
Default: 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_BITRATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Opus encoder setting. This is
the bit-rate that the encoder will encode for. Rates from
about 8000 to 64000 bits per second are meaningful but the
codec can handle from like 2500 to 512000 bps. Default:
20000bps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_VBR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Opus encoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) variable bit-rate encoding. If enabled,
the encoder will try to keep a constant quality by
increasing the bit-rate when needed and decrease it when the
quality can be assured with a lower bit-rate. The target
average bit-rate is the one set by OPUS_ENC_BITRATE.
Default: 1.</p>

<h3>Local Transmitter Section
<a name="Local Transmitter Section"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A local
transmitter section is used to specify the configuration for
a local transmitter. In the default configuration file there
is a configuration section called <b>Tx1</b>. The section
name could be anything. It should match the TX configuration
variable in the logic core where the transmitter is to be
used. The available configuration variables are described
below.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p>A single character ident for this transmitter. It is for
example used in state events published by transmitters
through a STATE_PTY or other state event consumers within
SvxLink.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>AUDIO_DEV</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the audio device to
use. Normally alsa:plughw:0. Have a look at the AUDIO DEVICE
SPECIFICATIONS chapter for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>AUDIO_CHANNEL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the audio channel to
use. SvxLink can use the left/right stereo channels as two
mono channels. Legal values are 0 or 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>AUDIO_DEV_KEEP_OPEN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The normal behaviour for
SvxLink is to open an audio device when needed and close it
when it does not have to be open anymore. This may cause
problems in some applications or with some sound hardware.
Set this variable to 1 to force SvxLink to keep the audio
device open from application start to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LIMITER_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set the threshold, in dBFS, for
the audio limiter. The audio limiter really is a compressor
with a very steep compression ratio like 10:1. The limiter
is used to help keeping down the audio level to not
overmodulate the transmitter. For a properly calibrated
SvxLink node max FM deviation is -6dBFS. A good value to
start with for this parameter is then -6 but try to lower it
further (like -9 to -12) if it does not affect audio quality
negatively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PTT_TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
to specify which type of hardware to use to control the PTT.
Specify &quot;SerialPin&quot; for using a pin in the serial
port, &quot;GPIO&quot; (sysfs=deprecated)/&quot;GPIOD&quot;
to use a pin in a GPIO port, &quot;PTY&quot; if you want to
use an external interface script via a pseudo tty port or
&quot;Hidraw&quot; to use the linux/hidraw driver to support
hidraw devices like CM108 sound card, e.g. URI device from
DMK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Set PTT_TYPE to
&quot;Dummy&quot; or &quot;NONE&quot; to not use any PTT
hardware at all. It is an error to not specify PTT_TYPE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Use PTT_PIN to
specify the pin to use for &quot;SerialPin&quot; or
&quot;GPIO&quot;,</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Use
PTT_GPIOD_LINE and PTT_GPIOD_CHIP to specify the GPIO pin to
use for &quot;GPIOD&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PTT_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the serial port that
the PTT is connected to. E.g. /dev/ttyS0 for COM1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PTT_PIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If PTT_TYPE is set to
&quot;SerialPin&quot;, specify the pin(s) in the serial port
that the PTT is connected to. It is possible to specify one
or two serial port pins. Some interface boards require that
you specify two pins since one pin does not provide enough
drive power to the circuit. A &quot;!&quot; in front of the
pin name indicates inverted operation. Some of the possible
values are RTS, DTRRTS, !DTR!RTS or even DTR!RTS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If GPIO was
specified in PTT_TYPE, set the PTT_PIN config variable to
the pin name of the GPIO-pin to use. The most common name is
gpio&lt;number&gt;, like gpio3. Some GPIO drivers use more
complex pin names like gpio33_pe11. Have a look at the USING
GPIO section for information on how to set up the operating
system. Normally, the pin will be active high but if the pin
name is prefixed with an exclamation mark it will be active
low instead. For some hardware platforms you may need to
also set the GPIO_PATH configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>GPIO_PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
to set the path to the sys control devices for GPIO. This
normally is /sys/class/gpio but on some hardware, like the
Orange Pi, the path is /sys/class/gpio_sw.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PTT_GPIOD_CHIP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The GPIO chip to use for PTT.
The application tries to figure out whether the value is the
path to the GPIO chip, its name, label or number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
PTT_GPIOD_CHIP=gpiochip0</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PTT_GPIOD_LINE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If GPIOD was specified in
PTT_TYPE, set this config variable to the gpiod line of the
GPIO pin to use. If a number is specified it is assumed to
be the GPIO pin offset within the chip. If a pin name is
specified SvxLink will try to find a pin with that name
within the chip.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, the
pin will be active high but if the pin specification is
prefixed with an exclamation mark it will be active low
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">For some
hardware platforms you may need to also set the
PTT_GPIOD_CHIP configuration variable, if the pin you want
to use is not on the default GPIO chip.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
PTT_GPIOD_LINE=17</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PTT_PTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If PTT_TYPE is set to
&quot;PTY&quot; this configuration variable will set the
path for the PTY slave softlink that is used by the external
script to communicate to SvxLink.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">SvxLink sends a
&rsquo;T&rsquo; to start transmitting and a &rsquo;R&rsquo;
to turn the transmitter off. This can be used by an external
script to interface custom devices, modems or other hardware
to SvxLink. Look for nhrcx.pl to see an example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to specify the same PTY for multiple functions (e.g.
squelch, DTMF etc) in both TX and RX configurations. This
may be good if there is one script handling all
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>HID_DEVICE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Define the device node where
your hidraw device is accessible at.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
HID_DEVICE=/dev/hidraw3</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>HID_PTT_PIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Define the pin your ptt control
is connected to. Valid parameters are are
GPIO1,GPIO2,GPIO3,GPIO4. Note that some sound cards like
SSS1621 may not support GPIO3 and GPIO4! You can invert the
behavior with a &quot;!&quot; in front of the name. Only one
value is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SERIAL_SET_PINS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set the specified serial port
pins to a static state. This can be good if using a pin for
reference voltage or if a pin have to be in a certain state
to not interfere with the operation of some equipment. There
are two pins that are possible to use, RTS and DTR. If
prefixed with an exclamation mark (!), the pin will be
cleared and if not it will be set. This configuration
variable can only be used when PTT_TYPE is set to
&quot;SerialPin&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
SERIAL_SET_PINS=RTS!DTR will set RTS and clear DTR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PTT_HANGTIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use this configuration variable
to set a PTT hangtime. This can be good to have on a
transmitter in combination with using a tone squelch. When
the transmitter is ordered to stop transmitting, the tone is
immediately turned off, causing the squelch to close on the
other side. Since the transmitter keeps transmitting for a
while, no squelch tail will be heard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Another use is
on a remote receiver link transmitter where you don&rsquo;t
want the transmitter to turn on and off between
transmissions or if the squelch close and open quickly due
to for example mobile flutter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This is a feature that will
prevent the transmitter from getting stuck transmitting.
Specify the number of seconds before the transmitter is
turned off. Note that this is a low level security mechanism
that is meant to only kick in if there is a software bug in
SvxLink. Just so that the transmitter will not transmit
indefinitely. It is not meant to be used to keep people from
talking too long.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TX_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of milliseconds
(0-1000) to wait after the transmitter has been turned on
until audio is starting to be transmitted. This can be used
to compensate for slow TX reaction or remote stations with
slow reacting squelches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_FQ</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The frequency in Hz of the
CTCSS tone to transmit. It is possible to specify fractions
using &quot;.&quot; as decimal comma (e.g. 136.5). For the
tone to be transmitted the CTCSS_LEVEL variable must also be
setup and also the TX_CTCSS variable in the logic core
configuration section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTCSS_LEVEL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The level in dBFS of the CTCSS
tone to transmit. A value of 0 is the highest level and
lower (negative) values give a lower level. What level to
set depend on multiple factors like the audio calibration
settings and the low-pass characteristics of the hardware.
Assuming an ideal audio path with a completely flat
frequency response over the whole audio spectrum, including
the CTCSS frequency band, and a standard audio calibration
where maximum FM deviation corresponds to -6 dBFS, the
following applies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The FM
deviation of the CTCSS tone should be in between 500-800 Hz
if using an FM channel with a maximum deviation of 5 kHz.
Given that you can calculate what the level in dBFS should
be:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Llow = 20 *
log10(500/5000) - 6 = -26 <br>
Lmid = 20 * log10(650/5000) - 6 = -24 <br>
Lhigh = 20 * log10(800/5000) - 6 = -22</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The default in
the configuration file is -24. For the tone to be
transmitted the CTCSS_FQ variable must also be set up and
also the TX_CTCSS variable in the logic core configuration
section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PREEMPHASIS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Enable this feature if you are
modulating the FM modulator directly, like through a 9k6
packet radio input. If no preemphasis filter is applied to
the audio, it will sound very dark when received. If you
modulate the transmitter through the microphone input the
radio will apply a preemphasis filter so this feature should
be disabled. 0=disabled, 1=enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_TONE_LENGTH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The duration, in milliseconds,
of DTMF digits transmitted on this transmitter. 100ms is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_TONE_SPACING</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The spacing, in milliseconds,
between DTMF digits transmitted on this transmitter. 50ms is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>DTMF_DIGIT_PWR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The power, in dB, of DTMF
digits transmitted on this transmitter. Zero dB will give
the same power in the generated signal as there is in a
maximum amplitude (full scale) sine wave. &minus;15dB is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TONE_SIGLEV_MAP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">It is possible to transmit one
of ten tones along with the normal transmission to indicate
a signal strength value to the receiver. This is of most use
when using a local transmitter as a link transmitter in a
RemoteTrx. It is not implemented, and probably not useful,
in SvxLink Server. Another requirement is that SvxLink has
been compiled in 16kHz mode. Otherwise this feature is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The
TONE_SIGLEV_MAP configuration variable is used to map tones
to signal level values. It is a comma separated list of
exactly ten values in the 0 - 100 range. The first value map
to the 5500Hz tone, the second to the 5600Hz tone and so on.
The last value map to the 6400Hz tone. What levels the tones
should be mapped to depends on the tone receiver
implementation. Typically, if using a SvxLink application as
a receiver, the TONE_SIGLEV_MAP should be the same in the RX
configuration for that node.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TONE_SIGLEV_LEVEL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">It is possible to transmit one
of ten tones along with the normal transmission to indicate
a signal strength value to the receiver. This is of most use
when using a local transmitter as a link transmitter in a
RemoteTrx. It is not implemented, and probably not useful,
in SvxLink Server. Another requirement is that SvxLink has
been compiled in 16kHz mode. Otherwise this feature is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The
TONE_SIGLEV_LEVEL configuration variable is used to set the
tone level. It is a value in the 1-100 range which indicate
the output level in percent of the maximum possible level.
The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LADSPA_PLUGINS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Used to set up one or more
LADSPA plugins to process the transmitted audio. The
processing chain is applied right at the top of the
transmitter audio processing and will only affect how the
audio sounds. Any digital signal processing done on the
audio after that, like DTMF, CTCSS etc, is unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;LADSPA PLUGIN USAGE&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>MASTER_GAIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This configuration variable can
be used to fine tune or increase the audio gain for all
transmitted sound if it&rsquo;s not possible to do using the
normal sound card hardware gain controls. The gain should be
given in dB and can be both positive and negative.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OB_AFSK_ENABLE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set to 1 to enable transmission
of metadata like signal level measurements, DTMF digits and
tone detections via out-of-band (OB) AFSK. The out-of-band
AFSK is transmitted above the voice band so that it is
possible to transmit AFSK bursts at the same time as someone
is speaking. The AFSK bursts are filtered out before the
audio is handed on to the next stage so normal users should
never hear the AFSK bursts. The AFSK feature is typically
used on a remote receiver uplink. The protocol used is
SvxLink specific. Data is transmitted in 300Bd with a shift
of 170Hz and a center frequency of 5500Hz. The RemoteTrx
application have the capability to transmit this
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OB_AFSK_VOICE_GAIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">To be able to send both voice
and AFSK at the same time it may be necessary to lower the
level of the voice audio as to not overdrive the
transmitter. This is compensated in the link receiver by
amplifying the voice audio back to its original level. This
configuration variable should thus be set to the negated
value of the same configuration variable in the receiver
section of the receiving node. If it&rsquo;s set to 6dB in
the receiver configuration it should be set to -6dB
here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OB_AFSK_LEVEL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The out-of-band AFSK modulation
level in dBFS (dB full scale). Default is -6dB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OB_AFSK_TX_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of milliseconds to
send AFSK flag bytes before sending the actual data when
transmitting an out-of-band packet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IB_AFSK_ENABLE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set to 1 to enable transmission
of an initial signal level measurement via in-band (IB)
AFSK. This is used in cooperation with the out-of-band AFSK
feature to quickly transfer a signal level measurement to
get the squelch opened. The in-band AFSK is transmitted in
the voice band and can thus use the higher baudrate of
1200Bd. Since it&rsquo;s only transmitted when the squelch
is closed the end user will not hear the AFSK burst. The
AFSK feature is typically used on a remote receiver uplink.
The protocol used is SvxLink specific. Data is transmitted
in 1200Bd with a shift of 1000Hz and a center frequency of
1700Hz. The RemoteTrx application have the capability to
transmit this protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IB_AFSK_LEVEL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The in-band AFSK modulation
level in dBFS (dB full scale). Default is -6dB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IB_AFSK_TX_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of milliseconds to
send AFSK flag bytes before sending the actual data when
transmitting an in-band packet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CTRL_PTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set this configuration variable
to the path of a PTY to use for controlling a transmitters
frequency and modulation. This can be used to interface a
transmitter to SvxLink using a translation script, like
trx_pty_ctrl.py. To set the transmit frequency, SvxLink will
send the sequence &quot;F&lt;frequency&gt;;&quot;. The
frequency will be in Hz, e.g. F145550000; will be sent to
set the receiver to 145.550MHz.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">To set the
modulation the command is &quot;M&lt;modulation&gt;;&quot;.
Look at the documentation of the MODULATION configuration
variable to see which modulations are available. To set
&quot;normal&quot; 25kHz channel spaced FM the command would
be MFM;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to specify the same PTY for multiple functions (e.g.
squelch, ptt etc) in both TX and RX configurations. This may
be good if there is one script handling all functions.</p>

<h3>Networked Transmitter Section
<a name="Networked Transmitter Section"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A networked
transmitter section is used to specify the configuration for
a transmitter connected through a TCP/IP network. In the
default configuration file there is a networked transceiver
configuration section called <b>NetTx</b>. The section name
could be anything. It should match the TX configuration
variable in the logic core where the transmitter is to be
used. The available configuration variables are described
below. How to use a networked transmitter is further
described in the <b>remotetrx</b>(1) manual page.</p>

listen on. The default is 5210.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LOG_DISCONNECTS_ONCE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set this configuration variable
to 1 to suppress logging of multiple disconnect messages in
a row, like when there is no RemoteTrx running on the other
side. Thus, failed reconnect attempts will not be logged at
all. This may be of use if a RemoteTrx is missing for a long
time or if it&rsquo;s only used from time to time. The
default is 0 which means that all reconnect attempts will be
logged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>AUTH_KEY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This is the authentication key
(password) to use to connect to the RemoteTrx server. The
same key have to be specified in the RemoteTrx
configuration. If no key is specified in the RemoteTrx
config, the login will be unauthenticated. A good
authentication key should be 20 characters long. If the same
RemoteTrx is used for both RX and TX, the same key must be
specified in the RX as well as in the TX configuration
section. The key will never be transmitted over the network.
A HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response procedure will be used for
authentication.</p>

remote transmitter. Available codecs are: RAW (512kbps), S16
(256kbps), GSM (13.2kbps), SPEEX (8-25kbps), OPUS
(8-64kbps). These are raw bit-rate values. There will be
some overhead added to this so the real bit-rates on the
wire are a little bit higher. The OPUS codec is the most
modern one and it also have the best quality for a given
bit-rate. There also is a NULL codec that will just throw
away samples which can be used in special situations when
the audio is sent through another audio path.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_FRAMES_PER_PACKET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. Each
Speex frame contains 20ms audio. If using a low bit-rate
configuration, the network overhead will be quite noticeable
if sending each frame in its own packet. One way to lower
the overhead is to send multiple frames in each network
packet. The drawback with doing this is that you get more
delay. If setting this option to something like 4 (default),
the delay will be about 4x20=80ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_QUALITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. Specify
the encoder quality using a number between 0-10. Lower
values give poorer quality and lower bit-rates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_BITRATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. Specify
the bit-rate to use. Speex will snap to the nearest lower
possible bit-rate. Possible values range from 2150 to 24600
bps. You should probably not specify quality at the same
time as bit-rate. Not sure though...</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_COMPLEXITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. The
complexity setting (0-10) tells the encoder how much CPU
time it should spend on doing a good job. The difference in
SNR between the lowest and highest value is about 2dB. Set
it as high as possible without overloading the CPU on the
encoding computer (check CPU usage using command
&quot;top&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_VBR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) variable bit-rate encoding. If enabled,
the encoder will try to keep a constant quality by
increasing the bit-rate when needed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_VBR_QUALITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. The
quality (0-10) to use in variable bit-rate mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_ABR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex encoder setting. The
average bit-rate encoding will try to keep a target bit-rate
by continuously adjusting the quality. This configuration
variable specify the target bit-rate and enable ABR. It also
need to have VBR enabled so don&rsquo;t force it to off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SPEEX_DEC_ENHANCER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Speex decoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) the perceptual enhancer in the decoder.
Perceptual enhancement is a part of the decoder which, when
turned on, attempts to reduce the perception of the
noise/distortion produced by the encoding/decoding process.
In most cases, perceptual enhancement brings the sound
further from the original objectively (e.g. considering only
SNR), but in the end it still sounds better (subjective
improvement).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_FRAME_SIZE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Opus encoder setting. Specify
how large, in milliseconds, each audio packet should be.
Default: 20ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_COMPLEXITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Opus encoder setting. The
complexity setting (0-10) tells the encoder how much CPU
time it should spend on doing a good job. Set it as high as
possible without overloading the CPU on the encoding
computer (check CPU usage using command &quot;top&quot;).
Default: 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_BITRATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Opus encoder setting. This is
the bit-rate that the encoder will encode for. Rates from
about 8000 to 64000 bits per second are meaningful but the
codec can handle from like 2500 to 512000 bps. Default:
20000bps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_VBR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Opus encoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) variable bit-rate encoding. If enabled,
the encoder will try to keep a constant quality by
increasing the bit-rate when needed and decrease it when the
quality can be assured with a lower bit-rate. The target
average bit-rate is the one set by OPUS_ENC_BITRATE.
Default: 1.</p>

stations. For a repeater that is the &quot;shift&quot; (e.g.
-600). For a simplex node it&rsquo;s most often 0. The
limits for the offset is [-9990,+9990] kHz. If not specified
it will be set to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
the APRS packet is transmitted the value is expressed in
tens of kHz. So if the configuration parameter is set to
-600 kHz, it will be sent as -060.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>TX_POWER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The power of your transmitter
in watts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The maximum
power allowed in the APRS protocol is 81 watts so if a power
grater than that is specified it will be set to that maximum
value. However, the advice is to set it to the actual power
if the protocol evolves to handle higher powers in the
future. So if your transmitter outputs 200 watts, set it to

<h2>AUDIO DEVICE SPECIFICATIONS
<a name="AUDIO DEVICE SPECIFICATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The AUDIO_DEV
configuration variables specify which audio device to use
for a receiver or transmitter. SvxLink support a number of
different audio input and output devices. The format of the
configuration variable is &quot;type:dev_spec&quot;. There
are three different types of audio devices supported,
&quot;alsa&quot;, &quot;oss&quot; and &quot;udp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;alsa&quot; type will use the specified Alsa device.
Example: &quot;alsa:plughw:0&quot;. Describing the format of
Alsa device names is outside the scope for this
document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;oss&quot; type will use the specified OSS audio
device. Example &quot;oss:/dev/dsp&quot;. OSS is the old
sound system used by Linux. Alsa should be used when
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;udp&quot; type is not really an audio device but
instead will read and write audio from/to a UDP socket. This
can be used to interface SvxLink to all sorts of audio
sources/sinks capable of streaming raw audio through UDP.
One example usage is to interface SvxLink with GNU Radio.
Example: &quot;udp:127.0.0.1:10000&quot;. Note however that
the only supported format is raw 16 bit signed samples, two
interleved channels. Sampling frequency can be chosen using
the CARD_SAMPLE_RATE config variable as usual.</p>

<h2>USING GPIO
<a name="USING GPIO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">GPIO (General
Purpose IO) is used to access hardware pins that are made
available for example on an embedded system. Before starting
to use a pin in SvxLink some setup need to be done in the
operating system. With the standard distribution of SvxLink
there is a pair of scripts that help with setting up and
taking down the GPIO pins. The scripts are named
svxlink_gpio_up and svxlink_gpio_down. The configuration
file, which can be found among the other SvxLink
configuration files (typically in /etc/svxlink), is called
gpio.conf.</p>

<h2>CALIBRATING THE SIGNAL LEVEL DETECTOR
<a name="CALIBRATING THE SIGNAL LEVEL DETECTOR"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The signal level
detector is used when using multiple receivers or when using
the SIGLEV squelch. The signal level is used by a voter to
choose the receiver with the highest signal strength. The
choice is made directly after squelch open. For the voter to
make a correct choice, the signal level detector must be
calibrated on each receiver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To use the noise
signal level detector, first set SIGLEV_DET=NOISE or, since
NOISE is the default, just make sure that it&rsquo;s unset.
There are two configuration variables that is used to
calibrate the detector. They are SIGLEV_SLOPE and
SIGLEV_OFFSET in a local receiver section. The slope is the
gain of the detector and the offset is used to adjust the
detector so that when there is no input signal, the detector
will return 0. The goal is to adjust the detector so that
when no signal is received, a value of 0 is produced and
when full signal strength is received, a value of 100 is
produced. It will never be exact but that does not matter as
long as each receiver produce a measurement that roughly has
the same siglev value as the other receivers for a certain
signal level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The calibration
is normally done by using the <b>siglevdetcal</b>(1)
application. To be able to do a correct calibration, it must
be possible to open the squelch so that only noise is
received. The antenna cable should be disconnected or a
dummy load should be used. <b>WARNING:</b> Before starting
the siglevdetcal application, pull the PTT cable since the
PTT might get triggered during the calibration
procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The siglevdetcal
utility will also measure the CTCSS tone SNR offset so that
the CTCSS_SNR_OFFSETS configuration variable can be set up
to a proper value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the
siglevdetcal application cannot be used for some reason, the
manual procedure below might be used. This procedure will
only work for a receiver with unsquelched audio.
<b>Note:</b> To calibrate a remote receiver it must be
connected to the SvxLink server. Otherwise the squelch will
not open.</p>

<h2>LADSPA PLUGIN USAGE
<a name="LADSPA PLUGIN USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">LADSPA is a
framework for sharing pluggable audio components and there
are numerous plugins to choose from. Each plugin has a name
(&quot;label&quot;) and zero or more configuration
parameters (&quot;control input ports&quot;). To find out
which plugins are installed on your system, use the
&quot;listplugins&quot; command. If you are missing some
plugin it may be available to install using your package
manager (rpm/yum/dnf, deb/apt etc). To find out more
information about a plugin, use the
&quot;analyseplugin&quot; command (e.g. analyseplugin filter
hpf). Learn more about the LADSPA framework in their
official documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In SvxLink only
plugins that have exactly one audio input and one audio
output can be used, so all stereo plugins are excluded for
example. The same thing is valid for input-only or
output-only plugins.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
analyseplugin utility will, among other things, list the
ports. All ports that are typed as &quot;input,
control&quot; can be used to configure the plugin. Valid
range and a default value may also be listed. The format for
the LADSPA_PLUGINS configuration variable in SvxLink is
&quot;label1:port1:port2:...:portN,label2:port1:port2:...:portN,@MyPlugConfig,...&quot;.
Note that only control input ports are counted here so when
applying the parameters any intermingled ports of other
types are skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If an instance
config start with an @-sign, a configuration section with
the given name is used to configure the plugin. There must
be a LABEL configuration item and the rest of the
configuration variables in that section must match input
control port names in the plugin instance specified by
LABEL. The config variable names are matched against the
beginning of the port names but does not have to match the
whole name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">LADSPA_PLUGINS=hpf:1000,@Tx1_Compressor</p>
