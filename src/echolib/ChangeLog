 1.3.4 -- 25 Feb 2024
----------------------

* Replace potentially dangerous function call 'localtime' with 'localtime_r'.

* Smaller adaptions to new networking code in Async.



 1.3.3 -- 30 Dec 2017
----------------------

* Fix return value inconsistency in EchoLinkQso. Patch by Steve DH1DM.



 1.3.2 -- 22 Nov 2015
----------------------

* Fixed issues reported by the Coverity scan static analysis tool.



 1.3.1 -- 02 Apr 2015
----------------------

* Bugfix: Fixes issue #87 "Suddenly stops speaking to the EchoLink directory
  server".



 1.3.0 -- 02 Aug 2014
----------------------

* Now possible to bind to a specific IP address to use a specific network
  interface.

* Improved EchoLink RX timeout handling.
  The previous EchoLink RX timeout handling was a little bit too simplistic.
  It could not handle clients sending larger audio packets, like Apple devices
  seem to do. The new algorithm adapts the timeout value to how much audio
  data have been received, making the timeout longer if a larger audio packet
  is received.

* Fixed issues reported by the Coverity scan static analysis tool.



 1.2.0 -- 29 Jul 2013
----------------------

* Added support for EchoLink proxy.

* Now possible to configure multiple servers for the directory server. The
  servers will be tried in order until a working one is found.
  Host names that resolve to multiple IP addresses, like servers.echolink.org,
  will also be correctly handled so that each resolved IP address will be
  tried in order until a working one is found.



 1.1.0 -- 06 Jun 2013
----------------------

* Now possible to force use of GSM codec only. This may be necessary on
  less powerful systems.



 1.0.0 -- 08 Mar 2013
----------------------

* Moved from sigc++ version 1.2 to version 2.
  Patch contributed by Felix/WU8K.

* Fixed a small bug which could cause a crash in a very strange and
  probably unusual case.

* Bugfix: Remote station name was clipped if it contained a space character.



 0.14.1 -- 05 Nov 2011
-----------------------

* Bugfix: Stations (links, repeaters, conferences etc) was not sorted
  properly. Entries could end up in the wrong category.



 0.14.0 -- 14 May 2011
-----------------------

* Bugfix: When receiving multiple bye packets, the disconnection was
  announced multiple times.

* Added Speex codec support to EchoLink connections. This only work
  between two SvxLink nodes (or Qtel) at the moment.



 0.13.1 -- 26 Apr 2009
-----------------------

* Cleanup by DH1DM / Steve.



 0.13.0 -- 18 May 2008
-----------------------

* Changes to adapt the internal audio infrastructure to the audio pipe
  concept.



 0.12.1 -- 02 Jan 2008
-----------------------

* Fixes for 64 bit platforms.

* Fixed some warnings that appeared with gcc 4.2.



 0.12.0 -- 15 Apr 2007
-----------------------

* Now not possible to send audio/info/chat packets while not connected.
  Also, incoming audio/info/chat packets are thrown away when not connected.

* New method: Qso::currentState.

* Now using libsigc++ version 1.2 instead of the old and outdated 1.0.

* Bugfix: The Dispatcher object instance variable was not cleared when
  the dispatcher object was deleted.



 0.11.0 -- 02 Dec 2005
-----------------------

* Now possible to search for stations using only digits. All letters are
  mapped to a digit in the same way as they are mapped on many phones:
  ABC=2, DEF=3, GHI=4, JKL=5, MNO=6, PQRS=7, TUV=8, WXYZ=9. All other
  characters are mapped to digit 1.



 0.10.2 -- 09 Oct 2005
-----------------------

* Bugfix in EchoLib::Directory: Fixed the "Unexpected reply from directory
  server" bug.



 0.10.1 -- 14 Aug 2005
-----------------------

* Bugfix: There was no timeout on commands sent to the directory server.
  This caused hanging connections when the directory server did not
  answer properly. The timeout is now two minutes.

* Bugfix: The callsign was not converted to upper case in
  EchoLink::Directory::setLocalCallsign as it should.

* Now converting the callsign to upper case i EchoLink::Qso::setCallsign.



 0.10.0 -- 25 Mar 2005
----------------------

* Fixed a compilation error which occured with newer compilers. The
  declaration of class Qso::GsmVoicePacket was not standards compliant.

* Fixed a memory leak. The GSM codec instance was not destroyed when the
  Qso object was destroyed.

* Instead of crashing (assert) when the registration of a connection fails
  we now return an error.

* Added getters for localCallsign, localName and localInfo.



 0.9.0 -- 26 Sep 2004
----------------------

* Bugfix: Server messages was not handled correctly.

* Fixed a strange error message.

* The getCalls method now emits the error signal when the status is not
  ONLINE or BUSY.

* Added the possibility to send and receive raw GSM audio packets. This is
  good for forwarding audio in for example a conference node.

* Bugfix: The wanted directory status was used in some places where the
  current directory status (the true status) should be used.



 0.8.0 -- 27 May 2004
----------------------

* Now able to use an unmodified GSM library include file.

* New method: isRemoteInitiated.

* Made the RX indicator a bit snappier.



 0.7.2 -- 04 Apr 2004
----------------------

* Look for earlier ChangeLog entries in ../qtel/ChangeLog.

* Adapted for changes in the async library.
