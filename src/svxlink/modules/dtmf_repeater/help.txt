The DTMF repeater module is used to retransmit received DTMF digits. This can
be used to control other remote stations that is also DTMF controlled. All
entered DTMF digits will be retransmitted and ignored completely by SvxLink.

Deactivate the module by sending the number sign for at least three seconds.
